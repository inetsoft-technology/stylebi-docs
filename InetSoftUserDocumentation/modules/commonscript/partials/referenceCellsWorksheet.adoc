.Access data in the current row
****

Formulas run in the scope of the current row. Each cell value on the current row can be accessed by indexing into the `field` array using the appropriate column name or column index. The syntax is as follows:
[source,javascript]
----
field['column name']
// Example: field['quantity']

field[column_idx]
// Example: field[3]
----
For example, if '`quantity`' and '`price`' are two columns in the  data block, a formula column in the same data block can use the expression

[source,javascript]
field['quantity'] * field['price']

to produce the product `quantity*price` for every row of the '`quantity`' and ‘price’ columns.
****

.Access data on a previous row
****
You can reference the values of preceding rows by their relative offset from the current row. This feature is useful when creating differential formulas. The syntax is as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
field[relative_position]['column name']

// Example: field[-1]['Total Sales']  (previous row, in column 'Total Sales')
// Example: field[-3][3] (three rows above, in column 3)
----
****

.Access a column of any data block
****
You can reference a column with name ‘columnheader’ in a data block with name ‘Tablename’ as follows:

[source,javascript]
Tablename['columnheader']
****


.Access arbitrary cell by row index
****
To reference an arbitrary cell in any data block, you can specify the row location with a numeric index:

[source,javascript]
worksheet['Table Name']['columnheader'][row_ix]

If the data block has no spaces in its name, you can use the simpler syntax below:

[source,javascript]
Tablename['columnheader'][row_ix]

For example, the reference `Customers['CompanyName'][5]` specifies the value in the 5th row (using 0-based indexing) of the ‘CompanyName’ column in the ‘Customers’ data block.
****

.Access arbitrary cell by value lookup
****
Since most data blocks are dynamic, referencing a cell by row index (see above) should only be used when a data blockcontains a single row, or when rows are ranked. It is generally more useful to reference a cell by lookup using the data block’s primary key, as shown here:

[source,javascript]
Tablename["columnheader? primary_key == key_value"]

The “?” should be read as “where,” so the above expression can be read as follows: “Look in the data blocknamed ‘Tablename’, and return the value in the column named ‘columnheader’ where the primary key is equal to ‘key_value’.”

For example, if a data blocknamed ‘Customers’ has ‘customer_id’ as its primary key, you can reference the cell in the ‘CompanyName’ column having key ‘customer_id’ by using the following expression:

[source,javascript]
Customers["CompanyName? customer_id == 123"]

Instead of using a fixed key value such as “123” for comparison, you can also use the *field* value of the current row in the current data block. (See xref:#Accessdataincurrentrow[] above for the basic *field* syntax.) For example, consider a data block named ‘Customers’, which contains columns named ‘CompanyName’ and ‘customer_id’ (the primary key). You can access values in the ‘CompanyName’ column as follows:

[source,javascript]
Customers["CompanyName? customer_id == field.local_id"]

This formula says: “Look in the ‘Customers’ data block, and return the value in the column ‘CompanyName’ where the ‘customer_id’ key is equal to the value of the current cell in the ‘local_id’ column.”

.Cell Referencing
[example]
======
This example illustrates how you can reference the cells of another data block from within an Expression Column. You will use the tables in the menu:TABLE[SA] folder of the ‘Orders’ data source to create a data block that has columns for product ID, product name, category ID, and category name.

[NOTE]
include::ROOT:partial$importAllExamples.adoc[]


. In the left panel, expand the ‘Data Source’ node, the ‘Orders’ node, and the *TABLE* node.

. Drag the following fields from the menu:TABLE[SA>PRODUCTS] table into an empty area in the right panel. ({buttonCtrl}-click the field names to select them all, and then drag them together.)
+
[source]
PRODUCT_ID
PRODUCT_NAME
CATEGORY_ID
+
image:dataworksheet:ReferenceCellExampleMakeTable6.png[]


+
This creates a new data block named ‘PRODUCTS1’.

. Rename the ‘CATEGORY_ID’ column as ‘CAT_ID’. This will help to distinguish it from the data block you will add next. (See xref:dataworksheet:EditDataWorksheet.adoc[] for instructions on how to rename a column.)

. Drag the menu:TABLE[SA>CATEGORIES] table to the right panel. This creates a new data block named ‘CATEGORIES1’.

Let’s say that you want to add a column to the ‘PRODUCTS1’ data block that will contain the category name corresponding to each entry in the ‘CAT_ID’ column. The best way to do this is to join the data blocks together (see xref:dataworksheet:JoinData.adoc[]), but to practice using cell references, in this case you will create this new column as an expression column. Follow the steps below:

. Click the ‘PRODUCTS1’ data block to select it.

. Press the {buttonFormula} button in bottom panel. This opens the Formula Editor.

. Enter ‘CAT_NAME’ in the ‘Name’ field.

. In the Formula Editor, enter the following formula:
+
[source,javascript]
CATEGORIES1["CATEGORY_NAME? CATEGORY_ID==field['CAT_ID']"]
+
This formula says: “Look in the ‘CATEGORIES1’ data block, and return the value in the column ‘CATEGORY_NAME’ where the ‘CATEGORY_ID’ key is equal to the value of the current cell in the ‘CAT_ID’ column.”

. Select the ‘Script’ button at the top-right of the Formula Editor.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor. The two data blocks are now connected by a graphical link to indicate that the ‘PRODUCTS1’ data block references the ‘CATEGORIES1’ data block.

. Preview the ‘PRODUCTS1’ data block. (Click the data block to select it. Then press the {buttonChangeView} in the bottom panel and select {buttonLiveDataView}.)

+
The expression column in the ‘PRODUCTS1’ data bock now displays the category name corresponding to each entry in the ‘CAT_ID’ column.
