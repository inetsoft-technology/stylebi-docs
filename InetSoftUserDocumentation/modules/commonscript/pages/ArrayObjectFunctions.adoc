= Array Object Functions


JavaScript arrays are a non-fixed length arrays. A constant array can be created using an array literal:

[source,javascript]
states = ["NJ", "NY", "CA"];

This is equivalent to the array constructor:

[source,javascript]
states = new Array("NJ", "NY", "CA");

The length of the array is dynamically adjusted when new items are added to an array. If the newly added item leaves a gap in the existing array, the items in the gap have an `undefined` value.

[source,javascript]
states[50] = 'FL';

The `length` property of an array object returns the current array length.

[source,javascript]
for(var i = 0; i < states.length; i++) {
  if(states[i] == 'NJ') {
    // do something ...
  }
}

Array objects also provide the  methods described in the following topics.
