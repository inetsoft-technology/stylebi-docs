rate::			Interest rate per period
per::			Period for which to return interest (between 1 and `nper`)
nper::			Total number of payment periods in an annuity
pv::			Present value (positive for a loan, negative for an investment),  the lump-sum amount that a series of future payments is worth right now
fv::			Future value (generally 0 for a loan),  the cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made
type::			Timing of payment +
`0`: payment at end of period (default) +
`1`: payment at start of period
