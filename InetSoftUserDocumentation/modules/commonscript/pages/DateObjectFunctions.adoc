= Date Object Functions


The JavaScript Date object stores the time and date and can be used to manipulate dates and perform date conversions. There are several ways to create a Date object. Invoked without arguments, the new *Date* object contains the time and date of its creation:

[source,javascript]
var now = new Date() // Thu Jun 12 15:14:51 EDT 2008

You can also create a Date object by specifying elapsed milliseconds from January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch) or from individual date parts:

[source,javascript]
----
var due_date = new Date(800000000000);
// Tue May 09 02:13:20 EDT 1995

var due_date = new Date(1988,0,10);
// Sun Jan 10 00:00:00 EST 1988
----
NOTE: Scripts also have access to the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Date.html[java.util.Date] object.

The following topics describe  methods in the Date object for manipulating date fields.
