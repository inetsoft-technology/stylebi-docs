A regular expression or *regex* object contains the pattern of a regular expression. It has properties and methods for using the regular expression to find and replace matches in strings. A regular expression can be created as a literal:

[source,javascript]
var re = /.*JavA.*/i;

Alternatively, you can  create a regular expression using the RegExp constructor:

[source,javascript]
var re = new RegExp('.*JavA.*', 'i');

A regular expression can be used in the xref:StringObjectMatch.adoc[], xref:StringObjectReplace.adoc[], and xref:StringObjectSearch.adoc[] methods to find the regular expression in a string, or can be evaluated against a string using one of the  RegExp methods described  in the following topics.
