Returns the capital in a given periodâ€™s *payment* for an investment based on *periodic* constant payments and a constant interest rate. {CALCExcelFunctionPage}

TIP: Use xref:CALC_ipmt.adoc[] to calculate the portion of interest in a given payment. Use  xref:CALC_pmt.adoc[] to calculate the total payment (capital and interest).


== Parameters
rate::			Interest rate per period
per::			Period for which to return capital repayment (between 1 and `nper`)
nper::			Total number of payment periods in an annuity
pv::			Present value (positive for a loan, negative for an investment), the lump-sum amount that a series of future payments is worth right now
fv::			Future value (generally 0 for a loan), a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made
type::			Timing of payment: +
`0`: payment at end of period (default) +
`1`: payment at start of period



== Example
Amount of capital repaid in each of the first ten payments for an $8000 two-year loan with 10% annual interest and payment at end of period. (The negative values indicates that these are payments.)
