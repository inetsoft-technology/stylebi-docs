For a 4-4-5 fiscal calendar, returns the fiscal month corresponding to the specified `date` as a number, e.g., “8”. The `startYear`, `startMonth`, and `startDay` determine the starting point of the fiscal calendar. Leap years must be explicitly specified by the array `leapYears`.

In a 4-4-5 fiscal calendar, a typical year has 52 weeks totalling 364 days:
[square]
* The first month of each quarter is 4 weeks
* The second month of each quarter is 4 weeks
* The third month of each quarter is 5 weeks

Every few years (as specified by array `leapYears`), the fiscal calendar requires a 53-week year in order to reconcile with the solar year. In any such leap year, the final month of the last quarter has 6 weeks.
