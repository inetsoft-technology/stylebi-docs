The best method for boosting Dashboard performance is to create a _materialized view_. A materialized view is a caching strategy that pre-aggregates and stores the data required by a Dashboard  so that the Dashboard can respond more quickly at runtime. When a materialized view exists for a Dashboard, the server attempts to query the cached materialized view rather than querying the database. This can significantly  increase Dashboard responsiveness in many cases.

== Create Materialized View
To create the materialized view for a Dashboard, follow the steps below:

. Open the User Portal.

. Press the {buttonRepository} at the top of the User Portal.

. In the tree on the left side of the Portal, expand the folder containing the Dashboard that you want to materialize.

. Right-click the Dashboard that you want to materialize, and select ‘Materialize’ from the menu.

. Check the box next to the assets for which you want to create a materialized view.

. In the ‘Set Cycle’ menu, choose the cycle on which the materialized views should be regenerated.

. Press the btn:[Create/Update] button. If you select the ‘Generate Data’ option, this will immediately start the generation process and notify you upon completion. The materialized Dashboard is then displayed in the repository with a special {buttonMaterializationIcon}.
+
If you select the ‘Run in Background’ option, the materialized view will be scheduled to begin generation. You can check the status of the task under the *Schedule* page. (See xref:user:ScheduleDashboard.adoc[]. for more information about managing scheduled tasks).

== Delete Materialized View
To *delete* the materialized view for a Dashboard that is displayed with the {buttonMaterializationIcon}, follow the steps below:

. Open the User Portal.

. Press the {buttonRepository} at the top of the User Portal.

. In the tree on the left side of the Portal, expand the folder containing the Dashboard for which you want to *remove* the materialized view.
+
NOTE: The Dashboard should be  displayed with the {buttonMaterializationIcon}

. Right-click the Dashboard, and select ‘Materialize’ from the menu.

. Select the assets for which you want to remove the materialized view.

. Press the btn:[Delete] button.

. Press btn:[Close] to close the dialog box.

When the materialized view is removed, the Dashboard will run queries against the live database rather than against cached data.
