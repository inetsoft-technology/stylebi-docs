You can  display multiple *measures* by using visual properties (color, shape, size) or by using multiple axes. These approaches are described below.

include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]

== Color, Shape, Size

To display multiple measures using *color*, *size*,  *shape* or *label* representations,   drag a desired measure field from the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, or ‘Text’ region. See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for more details.

== Single Axis

By default, when you add two or more *measure* fields on the Y-axis, the selected data sets are plotted on adjacent sets of axes, as shown below:

In some cases you may want to display the measures on the same axis. To do this, press the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph} in the Chart Editor.

This fits both data sets on the same set of axes.

[#Stack]
== Stack
For some chart types, you can choose to stack multiple  measures on top of each other. To do this, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph} as shown above.

. Press the {buttonSelectChartStyle}, and choose a style that supports measure stacking (Bar, Line, Area, Point, Step Line, or Step Area).

. Select the ‘Stack’ option. This displays a ‘Stack Measures’ option.

. Select the ‘Stack Measures’ option.

. Press the {buttonApply}.

== Dual Axis

If the single axis is not appropriate for both measures, for example when one measure has much larger values than the other, you can create a secondary Y-axis on the right side of the chart. See xref:DualAxisChart.adoc[] for more details.
