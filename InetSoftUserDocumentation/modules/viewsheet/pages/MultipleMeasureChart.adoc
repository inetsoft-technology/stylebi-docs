You can  display multiple *measures* by using visual properties (color, shape, size) or by using multiple axes. These approaches are described below.

include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]

[#ColorShapeSize]
== Color, Shape, Size

To display multiple measures using *color*, *size*,  *shape* or *label* representations,   drag a desired measure field from the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, or ‘Text’ region.  See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for more details.

To change the visual appearance (color, shape, size) of the measures independently, press the '`Edit Color`', '`Edit Shape`', or '`Edit Size`' buttons in the *Visual* panel.  This allows you to use different sizes and different shapes such as triangles and circles to represent your measures.

[#SingleAxis]
== Single Axis

By default, when you add two or more *measure* fields on the Y-axis, the selected data sets are plotted on adjacent sets of axes, as shown below:

In some cases you may want to display the measures on the same axis. To do this, press the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph} in the Chart Editor.

This fits both data sets on the same set of axes.

In either case, you can change the visual appearance (color, shape, size) of the measures independently by pressing the '`Edit Color`', '`Edit Shape`', or '`Edit Size`' buttons in the *Visual* panel.

[#Stack]
== Stack
For some chart types, you can choose to stack multiple  measures on top of each other. To do this, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph} as shown above.

. Press the {buttonSelectChartStyle}, and choose a style that supports measure stacking (Bar, Line, Area, Point, Step Line, or Step Area).

. Select the ‘Stack’ option. This displays a ‘Stack Measures’ option.

. Select the ‘Stack Measures’ option.

. Press the {buttonApply}.

include::ROOT:partial$stackNote.adoc[]

To change the visual appearance (color, shape, size) of the measures independently, press the '`Edit Color`', '`Edit Shape`', or '`Edit Size`' buttons in the *Visual* panel.

== Dual Axis

If the single axis is not appropriate for both measures, for example when one measure has much larger values than the other, you can create a secondary Y-axis on the right side of the chart. See xref:DualAxisChart.adoc[] for more details.
