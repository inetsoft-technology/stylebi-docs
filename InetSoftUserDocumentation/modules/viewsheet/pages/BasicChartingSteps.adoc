A chart visualizes a _dataset_, which is a table containing rows and columns. Columns (also called fields) in the dataset are classified as either *_dimensions_* or *_measures_* in the Chart Editor.

include::ROOT:partial$dimensionTip.adoc[]

include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]

In some cases you may need to use a dimension as a measure, or a measure as a dimension.  To convert a field between dimension and measure in a Dashboard Chart, right-click the field in the *Data Source* panel of the Chart Editor and select ‘Convert to Dimension’ or ‘Convert to Measure’.

NOTE: To set different styles for different datasets, see xref:MultipleStyleChart.adoc[].

To create a stacked chart, enable the ‘Stack’ option at the bottom of the panel. If you do not select a specific chart style, the default ‘Auto’ style automatically selects a chart style appropriate to your dataset.

. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the data source, drag a desired dimension to the ‘X’ region.

NOTE: An administrator can make custom shapes available by placing the image files (png, gif, jpg) in the _portal/shapes_ directory of SREE Home. (See xref:administration:Presentation.adoc#LookandFeel[Look and Feel] and xref:administration:Storage.adoc[] for  information on how to upload a file to this location.) The icons are sorted alphabetically by file name. Custom shape images can be any size, and are scaled according to the ‘Size’ setting in the Chart Editor.
