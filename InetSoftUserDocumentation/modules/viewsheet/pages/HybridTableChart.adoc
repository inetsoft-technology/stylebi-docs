To create a hybrid table chart, follow the basic steps below:

. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *measure* (e.g., ‘Total’) to the ‘X’ region. This places the selected field onto the chart as a measure.

TIP: {convertToMeasure}


. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a desired *dimension* (e.g., ‘Category’) to the ‘Y’ region.

+
TIP: {convertToDimension}

. Drag the measure that you want to represent as text (e.g., ‘Quantity Purchased’) from the ‘Measures’ folder in the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Y’ region  (next to the dimension).

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the measure. Set the ‘Aggregate’ property as desired and enable the ‘Discrete’ option.
+
IMPORTANT: The  ‘Discrete’ option allows the measure to behave as a dimension.
+

. Press the {buttonApply}.
+
Observe that the chart now displays a column of values giving the aggregated measure value as text for each dimension value.
+

. Drag another measure (e.g., ‘Discount’) from the ‘Measures’ folder in the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Y’ region  next to the previous measure.

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to this measure. Set the ‘Aggregate’ property as desired and enable the ‘Discrete’ option again. Press the {buttonApply}.
+
IMPORTANT: The  ‘Discrete’ option allows the measure to behave as a dimension.

For example, set a number format for the ‘Quantity Purchased’ column and set a percent format for the ‘Discount’ column. Center-align both of these columns, and left-align the ‘Category’ column.

. Right-click the X-axis title, and select ‘Hide Title’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} Do the same for the Y-axis title.
