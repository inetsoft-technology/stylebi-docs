You can set the layout that determines how a Dashboard  is displayed on an electronic device and on the printed page.

[#CreateLayoutForMobileDevice]
== Create a Layout for Mobile Device
A Dashboard _layout_ identifies a class of devices (e.g., phone, tablet) based on screen dimensions. The Dashboard layout allows you to tailor the display of the Dashboard to this class of devices. To create a Dashboard layout for a device class, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

. Select the *Layout* tab.
+

. Press the btn:[New] button in the ‘Device Layouts’ panel. This opens the ‘Dashboard Device Layout’ dialog box.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Dialog.png[]

. *_Optional:_*  Add a custom device class to the ‘Select Device Classes’ panel. See below:
+
.Add a Custom Device Class
****
The four default device classes provided on the *Layout* tab of  the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box are:

[square]
* ‘Extra small devices’
* ‘Small devices’
* ‘Medium devices’
* ‘Large devices’

These classes are adequate for a majority of applications, but may not correctly characterize every device. For example, you may want a particular tablet device to use a “small device” layout even though the tablet’s actual width falls within the “medium device” range. In this case you can create custom device classes based on minimum and maximum device widths suitable for your application.

To add a custom device class, follow the steps below:

.. Press the btn:[New Device Class] button.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Dialog New Dev.png[]
+
This opens the ‘Screen Size’ dialog box.
+
image:Screen Size Dialog.png[]

.. Enter a ‘Label’ for the device class (e.g., “Small Tablet”) in the ‘Label’ field, and add an optional description of the class in the ‘Description’ field.

.. In the ‘Width’ fields, enter the minimum and maximum device widths that define this device class.
+
NOTE: The pixel values that you enter for the width should be *CSS pixel values*, not physical pixel values.
+
image:Screen Size Dialog 2.png[]

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box and add the new device class to the list of existing device classes.
+

NOTE: Custom device classes are saved globally, and can be accessed from any Dashboard on the server. Custom device classes that are used by a Dashboard are included with the Dashboard when you import or export the Dashboard from the server environment.  (See xref:administration:ImportExportAssets.adoc[] for more information.)
****

. In the ‘Select Device Classes’ panel, select one or more classes that you want to share a single layout. In the ‘Name’ field, enter a name for the shared layout.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Panel.png[]
+
The named layout is triggered whenever the Dashboard is being viewed on a device in one of the selected size classes. To customize the Dashboard for a named layout, see xref:#AssignDashboardComponentsToLayout[] below.

. Enable the ‘Mobile Only’ option to trigger the layout only when the Dashboard is genuinely being viewed on a mobile device. (This prevents the layout from being triggered on a desktop computer when the browser window is set to a narrow width.)
+
TIP: ‘Mobile Only’ enabled is the recommended setting.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Device Layout’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

[#CreateLayoutForPrint]
== Create a Layout for Print
A _print layout_ specifies the page settings for printing the Dashboard. This allows you to tailor the arrangement of the Dashboard to these page settings. The print layout  automatically modifies certain Dashboard components when the Dashboard is printed: *Tables* are fully expanded to show all rows, and *Filter* components such as Selection Lists and Range Sliders are presented with their current selections only.


To configure a print layout for a Dashboard, follow the steps below. (You can only define a single print layout.)

CAUTION: The print layout attempts to fit the contents of components within the bounds of the page layout, and may result in contents spilling over onto subsequent pages.

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

. Select the *Layout* tab.
+
image:Viewsheet Properties Dialog Screens.png[]

. Press the {buttonEdit} next to the ‘Print Layout’ field. This opens the ‘Dashboard Print Layout’ dialog box.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Dialog Print.png[]

. For the ‘Paper’ field, choose the size of paper on which the Dashboard will be printed. *_Optional:_*  To create a custom-sized page, select the ‘Custom Size’ option and enter the desired paper dimensions.

. Select ‘Landscape’ to force the Dashboard to print in landscape orientation.

. Select the desired units from the ‘Units’ menu.

. In the ‘Start page index’ field, indicate the page on which page numbering should commence. The first page is index 0.

. Select a value in the ‘Scale Font’ menu. This value multiplies the font size of all text on the Dashboard.

. Enter the desired values in the ‘Margins’ and ‘From Edge’ fields based on the units specified in the ‘Units’ menu.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Print Layout’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

To assign Dashboard components to an existing print layout, see xref:AssignDashboardComponentsToLayout[] below.

== Edit an Existing Device Layout
To edit the existing layout settings for a device class or print layout, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’'Dashboard Options' dialog box.

. Select the *Layout* tab.

. Select the desired layout in the ‘Device Layouts’ panel and press the btn:[Edit] button.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Edit.png[]

. Edit the layout as desired. See xref:#CreateLayoutForMobileDevice[] and xref:#CreateLayoutForPrint[] for more details.

To *delete* an existing layout, select the layout in the ‘Device Layouts’ panel and press the btn:[Delete] button.





[#AssignDashboardComponentsToLayout]
== Assign Dashboard Components to a Layout
You can tailor the arrangement of Dashboard components for different devices or for print. For example, if the Dashboard is viewed on a large-screen device you may want to display all the components of the Dashboard, but if the Dashboard is viewed on a tablet or phone, you may want to display only a subset of components in an arrangement that suits the smaller viewing area.

To assign components to a Dashboard layout, follow the steps below:

. Define one or more device layouts. See xref:#CreateLayoutForMobileDevice[] and xref:#CreateLayoutForPrint[] for more details.

. Verify that Visual Composer is currently displaying the Dashboard in design view (not preview).

. From the ‘Layout’ menu in the Dashboard status bar (at the bottom of the Visual Composer window), select the layout for which you want to assign components.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Assignment 1.png[]
+
The ‘Master’ layout is the standard design view of the Dashboard, which includes all components.

. For *print layout*, press the {buttonEditContent} in the toolbar, and select ‘Edit Content’.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Content.png[]

. *_Optional:_*  Press the {buttonGuides} in the toolbar and choose the guidelines you want to display in the layout view. The options provided (16:9 and 4:3, landscape, or portrait) are the most common screen proportions. Choose the option that most closely matches the intended device proportions. To hide the guidelines, select ‘None’.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Guides.png[]
+
Guidelines are provided for informational purposes only. Use the guidelines to arrange components so that the Dashboard best utilizes the available screen dimensions.
+
TIP: The final Dashboard layout is _automatically scaled_ to fit the device screen, so only the _relative_ sizes and positions of the components are important when you lay out the Dashboard. Components can be placed outside the guidelines if desired, and the Dashboard will be scaled to place these components on the screen.

. Drag components from the *Components* folder into the layout area. You can add each component only once into the layout.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Assignment 2.png[]


. Position and resize components in the layout as desired by dragging on the “move” handle and “resize” handles. Note that the *layout for print* provides multiple pages, and you can drag components onto any available page.
+
NOTE: Layouts for devices will be automatically scaled to fit the device screen.


. *_Optional:_* To force components to be displayed on a new page, drag a ‘PageBreak’ component from the *Toolbox* folder into the layout area. Any components positioned below the PageBreak will be shifted to the following page.

. *_Optional:_* For a Table component in a print layout (and for a Tabbed Interface, Container, or nested Dashboard that contains a Table), right-click the Table and select ‘Table Flow Control’ to choose ‘Fit Page Width’ or ‘Fit Contents’.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Assignment 3.png[]
+
For the ‘Fit Page Width’ option the table width is set to the width of the page. The column widths are approximately proportional to the size of the data they contain. If the contents are too wide to fit in the column, the size of the row is increased and/or the contents are wrapped. For the ‘Fit Contents’ options, the column widths are sized to fit the data they contain. If a row is wider than the page, the table is wrapped.
+

. *_Optional:_* For a print layout, add additional Text components into the page header or footer. See below:
+
.Add Text to Print Layout
****
To add a Text component into the layout, follow the steps below:

.. Press the {buttonEditContent} in the toolbar, and select ‘Edit Header’ or ‘Edit Footer’.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout Header Footer.png[]

.. Drag a Text component from the *Toolbox* folder into the header or footer region.
+
image:Viewsheet Layout HeaderText.png[]

.. Right-click on the Text component, and select ‘Properties’ from the menu to open the ‘Text Properties’ dialog box. Enter the desired text in the ‘Text’ field, and press btn:[OK].
+
image:Viewsheet Layout HeaderText2.png[]
+
NOTE: You can use the following special codes within the text that you enter: `pass:[{P}]` inserts the current page number, `pass:[{N}]` inserts the total number of pages, and `pass:[{D}]` and `pass:[{T}]` insert the current date and time. To control the formatting of the inserted values, use the optional `format` parameter, for example, `pass:[{P,format}]`. The format for page numbering should follow the syntax described in xref:viewsheet:DataFormat.adoc#NumberFormat[Number Format]. The format for date and time should follow the syntax described in xref:viewsheet:DataFormat.adoc#DateFormat[Date Format].

.. *_Optional:_*  To format the text, click the Text component to select it and select the *Format* tab in the left panel. Apply the desired formatting.
+
