= Script Tab

The *Script* tab of the ‘Properties’ panel is common to all components, and contains a Script Editor that allows you to insert component-level scripts. These scripts can modify component properties based on programmatic logic. See xref:viewsheetscript:AdvancedDashboardScripting.adoc[]  for complete information about scripting capabilities.
