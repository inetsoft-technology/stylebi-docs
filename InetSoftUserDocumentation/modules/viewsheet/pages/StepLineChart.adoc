. *_Optional:_* {multipleMeasure} {addMeasuresUsingVisual}

.  *_Optional:_* To specify an alternate order for drawing the lines between the data points,  drag a measure to the ‘Path’ region. The magnitude of the aggregates for the ‘Path’ measure will determine the order in which the chart points are connected. (The point with largest ‘Path’ aggregate is connected to the point with second-largest aggregate, and so on.)
