Filter components such as Selection Lists (see xref:AddFilterComponents.adoc[]) and filter Conditions (see xref:AddConditions.adoc[]) generally apply to data before it has been grouped and aggregated in a Chart or Crosstab. To filter data *_after_* it has been grouped and aggregated, use a Range Slider or use an ad hoc filter, as described below.


== Filter Aggregated Data with Range Slider
You can use a Range Slider to filter the post-aggregate data displayed by a Chart, Crosstab, or Freehand Table. To do this, follow the steps below:

. Drag a ‘Range Slider’ element from the *Toolbox*  into the Dashboard.

. Right-click on the Range Slider and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Range Slider Properties’ panel.

. Select the *Data* tab. In the ‘Table’ panel, expand the ‘Assemblies’ node, and select the component and aggregated field that you want to filter.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the panel.

This Range Slider will now filter the post-aggregate values in the selected Chart, Crosstab, or Freehand Table.


== Filter Aggregated Data with Ad Hoc Filter
The easiest way to filter a Table or Chart is by using Filter components. (See xref:FilterDashboard.adoc[] for more information.) However, if the Dashboard includes a Selection Container, you can also filter  by using the right-click ‘Filter’ option. To do this, see the sections   below:

[#AdHocFilterPostAggregateCrosstabData]
=== Ad Hoc Filter Post-Aggregate Tabular Data
To filter aggregated  data in a Crosstab or Freehand Table, follow the steps below:

. Right-click on the column that you want to filter and select ‘Filter’ from the context menu.  {rightClickOptions}
+
NOTE: The ‘Filter’ option is only available if the Dashboard contains a Selection Container component.

This opens a  Filter control for the column: Selection List for a string-type column, Range Slider for a numerical-type or date-type column.
+

. Make the desired selection using the Filter control, and click away from the column to submit. (See  xref:UseFilterComponents.adoc[] for information on how to use these controls.) The selections that you make are shown in the Selection Container.
+
IMPORTANT: For a Crosstab or Freehand Table with aggregation, a Range Slider filters the *post-aggregate* data.
