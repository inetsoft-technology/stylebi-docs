The Selection Tree component’s ‘Properties’ dialog box provides *General*, *Data*, and *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the component-specific properties available under these tabs.

== General Tab
The properties in the *General* tab in the ‘Selection Tree Properties’ panel are the same as those of the Selection List component.

NOTE: For a Selection Tree, the ‘Single Selection’ property allows you to  select the hierarchy levels that should be constrained to single-selection. To place a level under single-selection restriction, select a field from the ‘Level’ menu, and press btn:[Add]. To remove a level from single-selection restriction, select the field in the list, and press btn:[Delete].
