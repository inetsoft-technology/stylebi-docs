= Circular Network Chart
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

A circular network chart displays a network structure defined by pairwise peer relationships, and arranged with the nodes spaced along the circumference of a circle.  It is an alternative representation of a xref:NetworkChart.adoc[].

To create a circular network chart, follow the basic steps below:

.Configure your data
[IMPORTANT]
====
The chart should be based on a data set containing peer relationships such as that below, with optional relationship weighting (e.g., ‘Years’ below). See xref:dataworksheet:PrepareYourData.adoc[] for information on how to manipulate your data, if it is not currently in this form.

[TIP]
=====
If you are *new to charting*, see the following section:

. Press the {buttonSelectChartStyle}. Choose the ‘Circular Network’  style.  Press the {buttonApply}.

. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag the first peer  *dimension* to the ‘Source’ region.

TIP: {convertToDimension}

. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag the second peer  *dimension* to the ‘Target’ region.

. *_Optional:_* From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a desired dimension to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region to break out the diagram along this dimension.
+
WARNING: This will create a disconnected graph for each dimension value, which may not be desirable.

. *_Optional:_* To distinguish the nodes along a dimension by using color, drag a dimension from the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Color’ region in the ‘Node’ panel. Press the ‘Edit Color’ button to choose the dimension colors.
+

+
NOTE: The applied node style is based on the values in the ‘Target’ field. If some nodes are only ‘Source’ nodes and not also ‘Target’ nodes, these nodes will inherit the *edge color*. To force such  source nodes to adopt the color of their first target  in the data set instead, enable ‘Apply Aesthetics to Source Nodes’ in the ‘Chart Properties’ dialog box. See xref:ChartProperties.adoc[] for more information about these properties.

. *_Optional:_*  For a date dimension, press the {buttonEditDimension} next to the field name in the Chart Editor, and set the ‘Level’ to the desired date grouping. Then press the {buttonApply}.

. *_Optional:_* {multipleDimensionNoColor}

. To represent an aggregate on the chart nodes, from the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *measure* to the ‘Color’ or ‘Size’ region of the ‘Node’ panel.

include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]

. To represent the weight or strength of the connection between nodes, drag a weight  field (e.g., ‘Years’) to the ‘Color’ or ‘Size’ region.
+

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the measure, and select the desired aggregation method for the measure.
+

. To set a fixed size or color for the *nodes* (if not being used to represent dimension or measure), press the ‘Edit Size’ or ‘Edit Color’ button and set the desired value in the ‘Node’ panel.
+

. To set a fixed size or color for the *lines* (if not being used to represent dimension or measure), press the ‘Edit Size’ or ‘Edit Color’ button and set the desired value.

. To add labels to the nodes, drag a dimension to the ‘Text’ region.
