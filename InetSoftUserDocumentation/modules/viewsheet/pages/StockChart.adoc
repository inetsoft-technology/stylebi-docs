A stock chart, also known as an open-hi-low-close (OHLC) chart, displays four different *measures*, “low,” “high,” “opening,” and “closing,” and is most often used to plot trading information. A stock chart is functionally the same as a  xref:CandleChart.adoc[].

Note that for each week, the values of each of the measures  have been independently aggregated as specified by the ‘Aggregate’ property you set for each measure. The “high” and “low” measures are represented by the extremes of the vertical line, and the “open” and “close” measures are represented, respectively, by the left and right horizontal lines.
