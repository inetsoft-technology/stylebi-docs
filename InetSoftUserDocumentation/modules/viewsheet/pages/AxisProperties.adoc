To edit the labels and line format of an axis, right-click the axis or axis label, and select ‘Axis Property’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Axis Properties’ panel, which provides the following tabs: *Label*, *Line*, *Alias*.

NOTE: To hide axis line and labels, right-click the axis and choose ‘Hide Axis’ from the context menu. To reveal a hidden axis, right-click the chart and select ‘Show All Axes’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions}

== Label Tab
The *Label* tab offers the following options

== Line Tab
The *Line* tab offers the following options

Logarithmic Scale:: Set logarithmic scaling for the axis. (The logarithm base is selected automatically.)
Reverse:: Orient the axis with maximum at bottom, minimum at top.
Shared Range:: For a facet-type chart (i.e., a chart with both a *measure* and *dimension* on the same axis or with multiple dimensions on the same axis), this specifies that sub-charts in the same column share the same X-axis scaling, and sub-charts in the same row share the same Y-axis scaling. Otherwise, sub-charts are individually scaled.
Ignore Null:: For Date/Time and Categorical axes, ‘Ignore Null’ suppresses the display of null dimension values. When ‘Ignore Null’ is disabled, null values are represented without labels.
Truncate Long Labels:: When enabled, truncates labels that exceed 1/3 of the total chart width or height (using ellipses to indicate omitted text). When disabled, truncates labels only if they exceed 2/3 of the total chart width or height.
Show Axis Line:: Display the axis line, in the specified color.
Show Ticks:: Display tick marks on the axis line.
Axis Line & Tick Color:: Color of the axis line and tick markers.
Minimum:: Lowest value shown on axis.
Maximum:: Highest value shown on axis.
Minor Increment:: The interval between axis tick marks.
Major Increment:: The interval between axis labels. For a date/time field which is represented as a time-series (e.g., when ‘As time series’ is selected in the ‘Edit Dimension’ panel), the increment is specified in terms of the prevailing time unit (weeks, months, etc.)

== Alias Tab
The *Alias* tab  is available for *dimension* (categorical) axes, and displays a table containing the mapping between original axis labels and new axis labels.

To modify the labels of a categorical axis, double-click the cells in the ‘Alias’ column that correspond to the axis labels that you wish to rename, and enter the desired replacement text. Press btn:[OK] to close the panel. This updates the axis labels with the specified replacement text.
