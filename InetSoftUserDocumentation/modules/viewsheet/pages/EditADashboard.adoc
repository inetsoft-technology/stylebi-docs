To open an existing Dashboard for editing, you can open the Dashboard for viewing in the Portal (see xref:user:UseDashboard.adoc[]) and press the {buttonEdit} in the Dashboard toolbar.

IMPORTANT: It is generally recommended that you edit dashboards in a *development* or *test* environment rather than in your *production* environment.  If an edit causes undesirable Dashboard behavior, you will be able to identify and  troubleshoot the issue before it reaches production. Note that the "`Modification History`" audit report (see xref:administration:Audit.adoc[] in xref:administration:ManageServer.adoc[])  identifies  users who make any edits to a Dashboard, but  does not record the specifics of the modifications. Therefore, it is also advisable to mainatain backups.  (See xref:administration:ManageContent.adoc[])

To open the Dashboard without data, choose ‘Open in Metadata mode’. (You can also access Metadata mode from the ‘Options’ dialog box. See xref:DashboardOptions.adoc[] for more information.)

NOTE: Dashboards under ‘Private Dashboard’ are visible only to their creator.




If you press the btn:[Cancel] button in the Dashboard loading dialog box, the Dashboard is automatically displayed in meta-data mode. See xref:DashboardOptions.adoc[] for more information about meta-data mode.
