= Pareto Chart
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

A Pareto chart highlights the contributions of individual groups to an overall total. The chart consists of two parts: A bar chart that displays the dimension’s groups in order of decreasing value, and a line chart that provides a cumulative total of the groups’ values. The left axis of the chart represents the actual aggregate values, and the right axis represents the percent contribution to the overall total.
