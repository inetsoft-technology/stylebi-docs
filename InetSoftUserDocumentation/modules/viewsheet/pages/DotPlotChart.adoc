A dot plot represents a measure by its individual data points (_without aggregation_).

This type of chart can be useful when the dataset is very small, with fewer than approximately 20 data points for each dimension value.

WARNING: If the dataset contains too many records, the chart will not be able to display all the data points.


Follow the steps below to create a dot plot:

Alternatively, you can drag the measure field to the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, or ‘Size’ regions of the bottom panel if you wish to distinguish the data points using a visual format.

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the measure. Set the ‘Aggregate’ property to ‘None’, and press the {buttonApply}.

. *_Optional:_* To display a dimension value in the chart tooltip, drag the dimension from the data source panel to the ‘Break By’ region next to the existing measure field.
+

This will allow the chart tooltip to display both the measure and dimension values, as shown below (‘customer_id’ and ‘company_name’, in this example).
