NOTE: The ‘Snapshot’ option (if available) is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes. It produces a portable version of the Dashboard that incorporates an embedded (static) copy of the underlying data. This “snapshot” Dashboard can be loaded into another server installation via incremental deployment. (See xref:administration:ImportExportAssets.adoc[] for more details.)

. In the ‘Data Size’ panel, select ‘Match Layout’ to obtain the closest possible match between the appearance of the exported copy and the original Dashboard. Select ‘Expand Components’ to fully expand scrolling tables and scrolling charts to show all data. Select the ‘Only Data Elements’ option to limit the export to only the data-bearing components.

. Select ‘Current View’ to include the current state of the Dashboard in the exported file.

. {ExportCSV}

. Select the bookmarks that you wish to include in the exported file. The selected views are converted to individual pages (PowerPoint and PDF) or sheets (Excel) in the exported copy.

[#ExportDashboardwithEditableData]
== Export a Dashboard with Editable Data

IMPORTANT: Offline Dashboard editing features are available only if product is licensed for Dashboard Forms.

Dashboards provide several features to assist in _offline data editing_. You can export data from Table and Input components into an Excel file, edit the data values and make input selections within the Excel file, and re-import the revised data and selections into the Dashboard at a later time. This allows you to edit a Dashboard _offline_, while not actively logged into the server.

=== Dashboard Designer
To configure a Dashboard so that users can export data to an Excel file for editing (and subsequent importing), follow the steps below:

. For each table that you wish to make editable in Excel, right-click the table, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

. Select the *General* tab, and enter a unique name for the table in the ‘Name’ field. (This name will be used to label the table in the Excel export, and to match the Excel table to the Dashboard table during subsequent importing.)

. Select the *Advanced* tab, and check the ‘Enable Table Editing’ option. Select the desired editing features, ‘Add Rows’, ‘Delete Rows’, and/or ‘Edit Rows’. See xref:TableProperties.adoc[] for more information about these options.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

=== Dashboard User
To export a Dashboard for editing (and subsequent importing), follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonExport} in the *Dashboard toolbar*.
+
NOTE: Do not use the ‘Export’ button in the table title bar.

. Select the ‘Expand Components’ option.
+

. Under the *Location* tab, select the ‘Desktop’ option.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box and export the Dashboard.

This saves the Excel file (with the same name as the Dashboard) in the browser’s default download directory. You can now open the file in Excel, and edit the tables or modify input elements as desired. To re-import the modified Excel data back into the Dashboard, see xref:#ImportDashboardwithEditableData[] below.

IMPORTANT: Offline Dashboard editing features are available only if product is licensed for Dashboard Forms.

Dashboards provide several features to assist in _offline data editing_. You can export data from Table and Input components into an Excel file, edit the data values and make input selections within the Excel file, and re-import the revised data and selections into the Dashboard at a later time. This allows you to edit a Dashboard _offline_, while not actively logged into the server.

To import data from Excel into a Dashboard, the following conditions must be satisfied:

* The Excel file must be created by the export procedure described in xref:#ExportDashboardwithEditableData[] above. (If the Excel file was created by another process, the import will not succeed.)

* Each editable Table and Input component in the Dashboard must have the same name (set by the ‘Name’ field in the ‘Properties’ dialog box) as the corresponding table or input in the Excel file. These names are used to match the Excel components with the corresponding Dashboard components.

When you have verified the above conditions, follow the steps below to import the modified data from the Excel file:

. Press the {buttonImportExcel} in the Dashboard toolbar. This opens the file selection dialog box.

. Choose the Excel file that you want to import, and press ‘Open’.

This uploads the Excel data into the Dashboard tables with corresponding names, and updates input elements with revised settings. Records that have been added or edited within Excel are highlighted for better visibility.
