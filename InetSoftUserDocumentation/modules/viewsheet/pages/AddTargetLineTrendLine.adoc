A *target line* is a horizontal or vertical line drawn on the Chart that denotes an ideal value (goal or threshold) or representative value (average, minimum, etc.). A *target band* is a horizontal or vertical band drawn on the Chart that denotes either an ideal range (e.g., goal zone) or representative range (e.g., span of maximum to minimum). A *statistical measure* is a line or region drawn on the Chart to represent one or more statistical quantities derived from the data (confidence intervals, percentiles, etc.). A *trend line* (curve fit) is curve that is fit to the data based on a selected model (linear, quadratic, etc.).

[#AddStatisticalMeasure]
== Add a Statistical Measure

A _statistical measure_ is represented by one or more lines drawn on the chart to indicate the values of statistical quantities derived from the data (confidence intervals, percentages, percentiles, quantiles, or standard deviation).

image:commonscript:TargetStats1_1.png[]

To add a statistical measure, follow the steps below:

. Right-click the Chart, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Chart Properties’ panel.

. Select the *Advanced* tab of the ‘Properties’ dialog box.

. In the ‘Target Lines’ panel, press the btn:[Add] button. This opens the ‘Add Target’ dialog box.

. Select the *Statistics* tab.

. In the ‘Field’ menu, select the chart measure to which you want to add the statistical measure.

. In the ‘Computation’ field, select one of the following options to compute statistics from the data: ‘Confidence Interval’, ‘Percentages’, ‘Percentile’, ‘Quantiles’, ‘Standard Deviation’. (See explanations below.)

+
image:TargetStats2_1.png[]

. To modify the statistical measure, press the btn:[Edit] button. The following settings are available:
+
****
Confidence Interval:: For the ‘Confidence Interval’ option, enter a value as a percentage.
+
image:TargetStats4_1.png[]
+
The resulting top and bottom confidence bounds indicate the interval of values in which the “true” value is _expected_ to be found. For example, the “true” temperature in the chart below would be expected to fall within the displayed confidence interval in 99 out of 100 such samples. (In other words, the true temperature is expected to be _outside_ the confidence bounds purely by chance in 1 out of 100 samples.)
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats3_1.png[]

Percentages:: For the ‘Percentages’ option, enter a value or comma-separated list of values as percentages. In the ‘Of’ field, specify the basis on which the percentage should be computed. You can type a fixed value or select from the following presets: ‘Average’, ‘Minimum’, ‘Maximum’, ‘Median’, ‘Sum’.
+
image:TargetStats5_1.png[]
+
For example, to display percentage lines at 70% and 90% of the Maximum, enter `70,90` in the ‘Percentages’ field and select the ‘Maximum’ option from the ‘Of’ field.
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats6_1.png[]

Percentiles:: For the ‘Percentiles’ option, enter a value or comma-separated list of values as percentages.
+
image:TargetStats7_1.png[]
+
The resulting percentile lines indicate the levels below which the specified percentages of values are found. For example, percentile lines at 70% and 90% (`70,90` in the ‘Percentages’ field) designate the levels, respectively, below which 70% and 90% of the data are found.
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats8_1.png[]

Quantiles:: For the ‘Quantiles’ option, enter the number of quantiles to display.
+
image:TargetStats9_1.png[]
+
The resulting quantile lines are evenly distributed between 0% and 100% and indicate the levels below which the specified percentage of values are found. For example, enter `4` as the ‘Number of Quantiles’ to generate lines designating the levels below which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data are found. This creates four regions in the data: 0-25%, 25%-50%, 50%-75%, and 75%-100%.
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats10_1.png[]

Standard Deviation:: For the ‘Standard Deviation’ option, enter a comma-separated list of factors. Each successive pair of factors represents, respectively, the lower and upper multipliers for the standard deviation.
+
image:TargetStats11_1.png[]
+
For example, enter `-1,1,-2,2` in the ‘Factors’ field to draw lines, respectively, at 1 standard deviation below the mean, 1 standard deviation above the mean, 2 standard deviations below the mean, and 2 standard deviations above the mean.
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats12_1.png[]
+
Select the ‘Sample’ option to compute the sample standard deviation or select the ‘Population’ option to compute the population standard deviation. (The distinction between sample and population standard deviation can be found in any Statistics reference.)
****

. *_Optional:_*  Enable the ‘Entire Chart’ option to compute the statistical values based on measure data from the entire chart. Disable the ‘Entire Chart’ option to compute the statistical values for each sub-chart based only on measure data from the same sub-chart.
+
.Effect of ‘Entire Chart’ option
[example]
====
The following illustration demonstrates the effect of the ‘Entire Chart’ setting (‘Computation’ is set to ‘Standard Deviation’ in both cases).

. From the ‘Label’ menu, select one of the following label options:
+
image:Add Target_3.png[]
+
[square]
* Select ‘Enter a Value’ to type custom labels for the statistical measures. Labels for individual lines should be separated by commas. For example, if you are generating the 4-quantile (which creates three lines), enter three labels separated by commas, for example:
+
 Q1: 25% below, Q2: 50% below, Q3: 75% below
+
image:commonscript:TargetStats14_1.png[]
+
If you enter only a single label, this label will be attached to all the lines. This can be useful when you include customization codes in the label, as described below.
+
TIP: To enter a literal comma in the label, escape the comma with a backslash (e.g., `Q1\,25% below, Q2\, 50% below, Q3\,75% below`).

* Select ‘(Target Value)’ to insert the numerical value of the lines as the labels.

* Select ‘(Target Formula)’ to insert the name of the computation method (e.g., ‘Quantile 1’, ‘Quantile 2’, etc.) as the label, if applicable.

* Select ‘(Field Name)’ to insert the field name for the selected measure as the label, e.g., “Sum(Total)”.

. *_Optional:_*  To further customize the labels, press the {buttonEdit} next to the ‘Label’ field. This opens a panel in which you can manually enter the labels. Press the {buttonApply} when you have finished entering the labels.
