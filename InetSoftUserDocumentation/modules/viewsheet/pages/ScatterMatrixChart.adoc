A scatter matrix is a grid of charts in which multiple *measures* are plotted against one another in a pair-wise manner.

To create a scatter matrix, simply add each measure into *_both_* the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ regions, and then place a *dimension* in the ‘Color’, ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, or ‘Text’ region.

For example, in the chart below, each of the four measures appears in *_both_* the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ regions, and the dimension is bound in the ‘Color’ region.
