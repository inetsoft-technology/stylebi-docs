[#ZoomChart]
== Zoom a Chart
The Zoom feature allows you to focus in on a selected set of groups by specifying the groups to include or exclude from the zoomed view.

=== Select Groups to Include
To zoom in by selecting the groups you want to view, follow the steps below:

. Select the data on the chart that you wish to zoom.
+
include::viewsheet:partial$selectChartData.adoc[]


. Press the {buttonZoom} in the mini-toolbar. This zooms the chart to display only the data selected.
+
image:Chart Zoom Basic.png[]

. Repeat the above steps to zoom in further.

. To return to the original chart view, press the {buttonChartClearZoom}.
+
image:Chart Zoom Clear.png[]


=== Select Groups to Exclude
In some cases,  you might find it easier to create the desired view by specifying particular groups to _exclude_ from the zoomed view.

. Select the data on the chart that you wish to exclude from the zoomed view.
+
include::viewsheet:partial$selectChartData.adoc[]

. Press the {buttonChartExclude} in the toolbar. This removes the selected data from the chart.
+
image:ExcludeData.png[]

. Repeat the above steps to exclude further data.

. To return to the original chart view, press the {buttonChartClearZoom}.
+
image:ExcludeData2.png[]

[#DrillThroughChart]
== Drill Through a Chart
When a chart axis displays a date field or a cube dimension, the chart automatically provides the user with the ability to drill down to finer levels of resolution of the date or dimension.

To drill down into a date or cube dimension on a chart axis, follow these steps:

. Hover the mouse over the chart axis that you want to display at greater resolution. For axes that represent date or cube dimension data, this will display a {buttonDrillDown} at the left side of the axis.
+
IMPORTANT: The {buttonDrillDown} is only visible when you hover over the axis.
+
image:DrillDown.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillDown} to drill down to the next level of the date or dimension.

. Repeat the above steps to drill down to deeper levels of the hierarchy.
+
image:DrillDown2.png[]

. To drill up to a higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy, hover the mouse over the chart axis that you want to display at reduced resolution. This displays a {buttonDrillUp} at the left side of the axis.
+
image:DrillDown3.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillUp} to drill up to the higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you drill down into a discretely grouped date axis (e.g., date grouping level set to ‘Quarter of Year’, ‘Month of Year’, etc.), this creates a facet chart by repeatedly adding the date field as an additional dimension with a finer grouping level.

image:DrillDown4.png[]

However, when you drill down into  a continuously grouped date axis (e.g.,  date grouping level set to ‘Quarter’, ‘Month’, etc.), this changes the grouping level of the existing dimension rather than adding an additional dimension.

image:DrillDown5.png[]

The exception to this rule is the ‘Year’ level, which behaves as a discrete grouping and generates a facet chart upon drill down (as illustrated in the steps above).

====

To disable the drilling feature for a particular chart, deselect the ‘Enable Drilling’ option in the *Advanced* tab of the ‘Chart Properties’ panel. To specify a custom drill hierarchy for any set of hierarchical fields, including custom date levels, use the *Hierarchy* tab. See xref:ChartProperties.adoc[] for more details.

[#DrillThroughCrosstab]
== Drill Through a Crosstab
When a Crosstab header displays a date field or a cube dimension, the Crosstab automatically provides the user with the ability to drill down to finer levels of resolution of the date or dimension.

To drill down into a date or cube dimension on a Crosstab header, follow these steps:


. Hover the mouse over the Crosstab. For headers that represent date or cube dimension data, this will display a {buttonDrillDown} at the left side of the header.
+
IMPORTANT: The {buttonDrillDown} is only visible when you hover over the Crosstab.
+
image:DrillDownCross.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillDown} to drill down to the next level of the date or dimension.

. Repeat the above steps to drill down to deeper levels of the hierarchy.
+
image:DrillDownCross2.png[]

. To drill up to a higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy, hover the mouse over the crosstab. This displays a {buttonDrillUp} at the left side of expanded headers.
+
image:DrillDownCross3.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillUp} to drill up to the higher level of the date or dimension hierarchy.

. To fully expand thfe hierarchy for a dimension value, right-click the value and select the appropriate ‘Expand Hierarchy’ option. To collapse an expanded hierarchy, select ‘Collapse Hierarchy’.
+
image:expandHierarchy1.png[]

. To fully expand all the hierarchies for a dimension (column or row header), right-click a value of the dimension and select the appropriate ‘Expand Field’ option. To collapse an expanded hierarchy, select ‘Collapse Field’.
+
image:expandHierarchy2.png[]

. To fully expand *_all_*   hierarchies in the entire crosstab, right-click the table title and select ‘Expand Hierarchy’. To collapse *_all_* hierarchies in an expanded table, select ‘Collapse Hierarchy’.
+
image:expandHierarchy3.png[]

To disable the drilling feature for a particular Crosstab, deselect the ‘Enable Drilling’ option in the *Advanced* tab of the ‘Crosstab Properties’ dialog box. To specify a custom drill hierarchy  for any set of hierarchical fields, including custom date levels, use the *Hierarchy* tab.  See xref:CrosstabProperties.adoc[] for more details.

[%collapsible]
=====
include::ROOT:partial$videoVersion.adoc[]

video::306732112#chapter=16550996[vimeo,640,400]
=====

. Right-click on a Chart element to add hyperlinks to the chart elements (e.g., bars), or right-click on a chart dimension label to add hyperlinks to the labels. {rightClickOptions}


. Select ‘Hyperlink’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box.
+
image:Hyperlink Chart.png[]

. In the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box, define the desired hyperlink. See the  sections below for examples of how to configure  hyperlinks for the desired target:
+
* xref:#HyperlinkDashboard[]
* xref:#HyperlinkWebPage[]

. Add any desired visual formatting to the hyperlinks (e.g., underlining).  See xref:VisualFormat.adoc[] for more details.
+
TIP: To display hyperlink underlining by default, set property `hyperlink.indicator=true`. {EMPropertyConfig}


. Press the {buttonSave} button on the toolbar to save the Dashboard.

When the user views this Dashboard in the User Portal, they will now see hyperlinks on the chart elements or labels.



[#HyperlinkDashboard]
=== Hyperlink to a Dashboard

This example shows how Chart hyperlinks can be used to drill to a sample ‘OrderList’ Dashboard.

IMPORTANT: You may need to download the xref:ROOT:attachment$OrderList.zip[Order List Example] into your environment. (This requires access to Enterprise Manager.) See xref:administration:ImportExportAssets.adoc[] for instructions on how to import.



. In the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box, press the ‘Asset Link’ button.

. Select ‘OrderList’ from the ‘Link’ menu.
+
NOTE: The ‘OrderList’ Dashboard is designed to accept a parameter named `customer` that is used in a condition to filter the  companies  displayed in a Table. You will configure the hyperlinks that you add in the steps below to the ‘Customer’ > ‘Company’ attribute in the parent Dashboard to pass the company name into the ‘customer’ parameter of the ‘OrderList’ Dashboard.




. Optional: Enter a *tooltip* in the ‘Tooltip’ field.  (In the example we use “View company information” as the tooltip.)
+
TIP: The tooltip is displayed when the end-user hovers the mouse over a hyperlink. If there are multiple hyperlinks for a given attribute (which may be due to auto-drills added at the data model level), the tooltip is displayed when the end-user hovers the mouse over the name of the hyperlink in the menu of hyperlink options.

. Deselect the ‘Self’ option, and enter the name “NewFrame” in the ‘Target Frame’ field.
+
NOTE: The 'Self' setting is not applied during preview in Visual Composer.
+
This will cause the hyperlinked Dashboard to open in a window called “NewFrame” (i.e., this is the browser DOM ‘name’ attribute). If you want the Dashboard to open in the original Dashboard frame, replacing the existing Dashboard, leave the ‘Self’ checkbox selected.
+
image:Hyperlink Dialog Example2.png[]

. Press the btn:[Add] button in the bottom panel. This opens the ‘Parameter’ dialog box.
+
TIP: To delete an existing parameter, select the parameter and press btn:[Remove]. To edit an existing parameter, press btn:[Edit].

. Select the ‘customer’ parameter in the ‘Parameter Name’ menu. This is the name of the target parameter in the OrderList Dashboard.

. Select the ‘Company’ field from the ‘Value for Parameter’ menu. This is the name of the table column whose value should be passed into the Dashboard parameter when the user clicks the hyperlink.
+
image:Hyperlink Parameter Dialog.png[]

. Press btn:[OK].

. *_Optional:_* Repeat the above steps to add additional parameters.

. *_Optional:_*  Enable ‘Send Dashboard parameters’ to pass all existing Dashboard parameters to the target  Dashboard, including Form component values. The Dashboard parameter names must exactly match those defined in the target  Dashboard.

For this example, clicking one of the hyperlinks will now launch the ‘OrderList’ Dashboard in a new browser window, and the ‘OrderList’ Dashboard will display _only_ the orders for the specific company the user clicked.

[#HyperlinkWebPage]
=== Hyperlink to a Web Page

This example shows how you can use a hyperlink to target a URL, such as `www.google.com/search`.

. In the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box, press the ‘Web Link’ radio button.

. In the ‘Link’ field, enter the URL of the hyperlink destination with parameters omitted. For example, if you want the hyperlink to pass a value as parameter to the Google search engine, the ‘Link’ field should specify `https://www.google.com/search`.
+
[TIP]
====
You can also specify a *table column* to provide the URL links by selecting the desired column from the ‘Link’ menu.

You can insert  parameters into the URL   using the following syntax: `www.link.com/$(param1)/$(param2)`.  These parameters should be defined in the '`Parameter`' dialog box described below.  If you don't insert the parameters into the URL this way, they will be added as parameter-value pairs (`param1=value1&param2=value2`) as described below.

====
. Optional: Enter a *tooltip* in the ‘Tooltip’ field.  (In the example we use “View company information” as the tooltip.)
+
TIP: The tooltip is displayed when the end-user hovers the mouse over a hyperlink. If there are multiple hyperlinks for a given attribute (which may be due to auto-drills added at the data model level), the tooltip is displayed when the end-user hovers the mouse over the name of the hyperlink in the menu of hyperlink options.

. If you want the target web page to be displayed in a particular browser window, enter the name of the desired window in the ‘Target Frame’ field. (The specified name becomes the DOM ‘name’ attribute.) To open the target web page in the User Portal frame, select the ‘Self’ checkbox.
+
NOTE: The 'Self' setting is not applied during preview in Visual Composer.

. Press the btn:[Add] button. This opens the ‘Parameter’ dialog box.

. Enter `q` in the ‘Parameter Name’ field. This name will be the parameter name used in the URL that is automatically constructed. (The parameter name `q` is the parameter name expected by the Google search engine, which is the target website specified in the ‘Link’ field for this example.)

. Select ‘Company’ from the ‘Value for Parameter’ menu.
+
image:Hyperlink Web 3.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Parameter’ dialog box.

. Repeat the above steps to add additional parameters.

. The final configuration of the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box is shown below.
+
image:Hyperlink Web 4.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Hyperlink’ dialog box.

The hyperlinks constructed  will in general have the form

 https://remotehost?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3

where `param1`, `param2`, `param3` are the parameter names specified in the ‘Hyperlink’ window, and `value1`, `value2`, `value3` are the values of the attributes selected in the ‘Value’ panel.

TIP: To include parameters as part of the URL path, see the *Tip*  about the '`Link`' field above.

[#DrillwithFlyover]
== Drill  with a Flyover

[.videotitle]
.Watch Video: Filtering a Dashboard (Flyover Filter)
[%collapsible]
=====
include::ROOT:partial$videoVersion.adoc[]

video::359331010#chapter=16567745[vimeo,640,400]
=====

A _flyover view_ filters the information displayed in selected Dashboard components when the user moves the mouse over (or clicks on) particular regions of a chart, table, or crosstab. This effectively allows a Chart, Table, or Crosstab to behave as a selection element. Flyover is similar to a *data tip* (see xref:AddTipsToChart.adoc[]), except that the filtered components remain in their original positions (rather than following the mouse).

For example, you may want the Table below to display sales only for the particular product(s) that the user selects on the Chart. A flyover view allows the user to hover the pointer over the Chart to filter the table as desired.

image:Flyover Final.png[]

The filtered flyover component and the component that triggers the flyover can be based on the same data block or on different data blocks. In the latter case, the flyover component is filtered based on any matching fields in the two data blocks.

.Walkthrough: Flyover View
****
In this example, you will create a chart that displays quantity purchased by company. When the user hovers over (or clicks) a given company on the chart, this will automatically filter an associated Table and Gauge to display data for only that company.

. Create a new Dashboard based on the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]
+
include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]

. Drag a Gauge from the *Toolbox* panel into the Dashboard. Configure the Gauge to display the average quantity purchased. Follow these steps:

.. From the ‘Sales’ data block (top of the *Toolbox* panel), drag the ‘Quantity Purchased’ field onto the Gauge. This binds the Gauge to the data block.

.. Right-click the Gauge, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Gauge Properties’ panel.

.. Under the *General* tab, change the ‘Name’ property to “QuantityGauge”.

.. Set the following limits: ‘Maximum’=200, ‘Minor Increment’=10, ‘Major Increment’=25.

.. Under the *Data* tab, select ‘Count’ from  the ‘Aggregate’ menu. This will display the number of records (orders) for each company.

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Gauge Properties’ panel.

. Drag a Table component onto the Dashboard. Follow the steps below to configure the Table:

.. In the ‘Sales’ data block (top of the *Toolbox* panel), select the following fields: ‘Category’, ‘Company’, ‘Name’.

.. Drag the selected fields onto the Table component. This adds the three columns to the Table. Resize the Table as desired.
+
image:Flyover Table Gauge.png[]

.. Right-click the Table, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

.. Under the *General* tab, change the ‘Name’ property to “CompanyTable”.

.. Under the *Advanced* tab, select ‘Shrink to Fit’. This automatically sizes the table to the number of records displayed.

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box.

. Drag a Chart element onto the Dashboard. Press the {buttonEdit} in the Chart mini-toolbar to open the Visualization Recommender. Press the {buttonFullEditor} at the top right of the Recommender to bypass the Recommender and open the Chart Editor.

. Make the following selections:

.. From the ‘Dimensions’ node, drag the ‘Company’ dimension to the ‘X’ region.

.. From the ‘Measures’ node, drag the ‘Quantity Purchased’ measure to the ‘Y’ region. This creates a chart that displays quantity purchased for each company.

.. Press the {buttonEditDimension}, and use the ‘Ranking’ option to display only the top 10 companies. Press the {buttonApply}.
+
image:Chart Data Tip Top 10_2.png[]

.. {finishEditing}

.. Resize the chart as desired.
+
image:Chart w Data Tip_2.png[]

. Right-click the Chart, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Chart Properties’ panel.

.. Select the *General* tab.

.. In the ‘Flyover’ panel, click to select the two available components: ‘CompanyTable’ and ‘QuantityGauge’.
+
image:Flyover List.png[]

.. *_Optional:_* Select ‘On Click Only’ if you want the filtered components (‘CompanyTable’ and ‘QuantityGauge’) to update only when the user clicks on the chart. Otherwise, the components will update whenever the user hovers the mouse over the chart.

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Chart Properties’ panel.
+
NOTE: Data tips are not active in the design view. Preview the Dashboard to see them.

. Press the {buttonPreview} to preview the Dashboard, and hover the mouse (or click) over different companies (data or axis labels) in the Chart. Observe that both the Table and Gauge are filtered to display only the corresponding data.
+
image:Flyover Final.png[]

. To lock the selection to a particular company (or set of companies), click on the Chart to select the desired company (or hold the {buttonCtrl} key  and click to select a set of companies). This will lock the filter in place until the selection is removed.

NOTE: You can use a single component in both a  data tip (see xref:AddTipsToChart.adoc[]) and a flyover view. If you designate a data tip component for flyover duty, the component always remains visible on the Dashboard.

[#DrillDownFilter]
== Drill Down and Filter
When a Chart or Crosstab displays data with a defined hierarchy in the *Hierarchy* tab (see xref:ChartProperties.adoc[] and xref:CrosstabProperties.adoc[]), you may want to simultaneously drill and filter the data. For example, if the Chart or Crosstab displays sales totals by product category, you may want to drill down into a particular category and view the totals for the individual products in that specific category.

NOTE: This is different from the operations described in xref:#DrillThroughChart[] and xref:#DrillThroughCrosstab[] above, which drill to the next level of hierarchy but *do not* filter.

If you have configured a ‘Category’ > ‘Product’ hierarchy for a Chart, then you can drill and filter by following the steps below:

. Select the ‘Category’ group(s) on the chart that you want to drill and filter.
+
include::viewsheet:partial$selectChartData.adoc[]
+
image:DrillAndFilter1.png[]

. Press the {buttonDrillDownFilter} in the Chart toolbar.
+
image:DrillAndFilter2.png[]
+
This drills to the ‘Product’ level and filters the Chart to display only the data in the selected ‘Category’. A drill icon indicates that a drill is in effect.
+
image:DrillAndFilter3.png[]
+
IMPORTANT: All other Dashboard components that display this dataset will also be filtered. In this respect, the {buttonDrillDownFilter} behaves like a Filter component (Selection List, etc.).

. To reverse the drill and filter operation, select a group on the Chart, and then press the {buttonDrillUpFilter} in the Chart toolbar.
+
