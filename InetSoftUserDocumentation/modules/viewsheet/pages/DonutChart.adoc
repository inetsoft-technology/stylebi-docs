The donut chart is now complete.

== Advanced Donut Chart

The advanced donut chart is the same as a xref:PieChart.adoc[], but with a hole in the center and optional text within the hole. The hole can be an arbitrary color. The text is often used to display a grand total or other KPI, which creates the appearance of a chart-gauge. (See xref:AddAKPI.adoc[] for information about basic built-in Gauges.)

The example below displays Total Sales by Year.

include::partial$chartNewbieTip.adoc[]

This opens the ‘Edit Calculated Field’ dialog box for a Dashboard. (See xref:dataworksheet:CreateNewDataField.adoc[] for more information about Calculated Fields.)


. Enter a name (e.g., ‘Total2’) for the new field, and select the ‘Detail’ option. Click the measure  field (‘Total’) in the top-left panel to add it into the expression. This makes the new (calculated) field ‘Total2’ a duplicate of the existing ‘Total’ field. Select ‘Double’ from the ‘Return Data Type’ menu. Press btn:[OK] to close the Editor.

. *_Optional:_* Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to each measure, choose the desired aggregation method, and press the {buttonApply}.
+
IMPORTANT: You must set both measures to use the *same* aggregation method. The ‘Average’ method should not be used, as this may produce an incomplete donut hole.

. *_Optional:_* Add the respective year values to the pie slices: In the bottom-left panel, select ‘Total’ as the measure for which to set visual properties. Drag the dimension (‘Date’) field from the *Data Source* panel to the ‘Text’ region.
