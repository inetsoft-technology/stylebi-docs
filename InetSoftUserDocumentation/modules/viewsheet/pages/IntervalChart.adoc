= Interval Chart
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

An Interval chart is similar to a  xref:BarChart.adoc[] but represents *two measures* with each bar: A smaller value that defines the bottom of the bar, and a larger value that defines the size of the bar. (Note that the second measure specifies the vertical span of the bar, and *_not_* the upper value of the bar.)

To create an interval chart, follow the basic steps below:

include::partial$chartNewbieTip.adoc[]

. Press the {buttonSelectChartStyle}. Choose the ‘Interval’ style.   Press the {buttonApply}.

. From the ‘Dimensions’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a desired *dimension* to the ‘X’ region.

TIP: {convertToDimension}

. *_Optional:_* For a date dimension, press the {buttonEditDimension} next to the field name in the Chart Editor, and set the ‘Level’ to the desired date grouping. Then press the {buttonApply}.

. *_Optional:_* {multipleDimensionNoColor} {addDimensionsUsingVisual}



. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *measure* to the ‘Y’ region. This measure defines the lower value of each bar/interval on the chart.

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the measure, and select the desired aggregation method for the measure.

. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a second *measure* to the  ‘Size’ region. This measure defines the *_height_* of each bar/interval on the chart.
+
NOTE: As shown in the example, the second measure can be the same as the first measure, but with  a different aggregation method.

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the ‘Size’  measure, and select the desired aggregation method for the measure.
+
image:commonscript:intervalChartExp7.png[]
+
The lower value of each bar is specified by the aggregate ‘Y’ measure, and its height (vertical span) is specified by the aggregate ‘Size’ measure.

. You can add additional measures to the Chart if desired. See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for information on how to add measures using color, shape, or size representation.
