The following sections explain how to edit and format an axis title.

In the ‘Title’ field, enter the title for the axis. (The title text you enter will *persist* even if you later change the field displayed on that axis.) To add the default axis name into your custom title, insert a placeholder such as `pass:[{0}]` in the title.



****
Example:: If the Chart displays two *measures* on the Y-axis, ‘Total’ and ‘Quantity’,  enter a custom '`Title`' such as `pass:[{0} and {1} for all Employees]` to display the following Y-axis title: “Sum(Total) and Sum(Quantity) for all Employees”.

Press btn:[OK] to close the panel and apply the changes.


TIP: To *hide* an axis title, right-click the title text on the chart, and select ‘Hide Title’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} To show all axis titles, right-click on the chart, and select ‘Show All Titles’ from the context menu.

== Format an Axis Title
To format an axis title, click the title text on the Chart to select it, and select the *Format* tab at the bottom of the left panel.
