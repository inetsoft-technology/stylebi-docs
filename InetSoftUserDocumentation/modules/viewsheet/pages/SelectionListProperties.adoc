Show as:: The appearance of the Selection List:
* *List*: A scrollable list
* *Dropdown*: An expandible dropdown box. The ‘List Height’ sub-option sets the number of rows to which the box should expand.
Sort:: The sort order for the values in the Selection List:
* *Ascending*: Display all values in alphabetical or increasing order, including incompatible selections.
* *Descending*: Display all values in reverse-alphabetical or decreasing order, including incompatible selections.
* *Hide Others*: Display values in alphabetical or increasing order, but hide incompatible selections under the label ‘Others’.
Action::
* *Submit on Change*: Immediately update data in the Dashboard when any selection is made. If ‘Submit on Change’ is disabled, the Selection List only updates data in the Dashboard when the user clicks ‘Apply’.
* *Single Selection*: Allows only one item to be selected at a given time (mutually-exclusive choices). See xref:SelectionTreeProperties.adoc[] for information on how to select hierarchy levels.
* *Suppress Blank*: Removes empty values (caused by nulls in the data set) from the Selection List.
* *Select First Item*: Selects the first item when the Dashboard loads (if no items are preselected).

== Data Tab

The *Data* tab in the ‘Selection List Properties’ dialog box provides the following Selection List-specific properties.
