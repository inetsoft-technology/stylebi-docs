A Scatter Contour chart displays contours that correspond to the density of the plotted points. The points themselves are *not* displayed.

To create a scatter contour chart, follow the basic steps below:

. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *measure* to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region. This places the selected field onto the chart as a measure.

TIP: {convertToMeasure}

. Press the {buttonEditMeasure} next to the measure, and select the desired aggregation method for the measure.
+
IMPORTANT: For a scatter contour  plot you may not want any aggregation at all. In this case, select ‘None’ as the aggregation method.

. From the ‘Measures’ folder of the *Data Source* panel, drag a *second measure* to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region. (Use the region that does not already contain the first measure.)

. *_Optional:_* Drag a *dimension* to the ‘Text’ area to display labels on the Chart.

+
NOTE: For a Scatter Contour chart you cannot bind a data field to the ‘Color’ region.

. *_Optional:_* {multipleDimensionNoColor}

. *_Optional:_* To weight the data points according to a specified measure, drag a measure representing the weights to the ‘Size’ region. A larger weight assigns greater density to the point.
+
To change how the contours are focused on the data points (without weighting), press the ‘Edit Size’ button, and choose a fixed size value.

. *_Optional:_*  To change the characteristics of the contours, press the {buttonMore} in the Chart toolbar, and select ‘Properties’. In the ‘Chart Properties’ dialog box, adjust the following  settings under ‘Density Contour’ in the *Advanced* tab.
