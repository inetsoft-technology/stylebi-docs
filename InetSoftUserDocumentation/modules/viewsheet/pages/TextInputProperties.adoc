The Text Input component’s ‘Properties’ panel provides *General*, *Option*, and *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the component-specific properties available under these tabs.

== General Tab
In addition to the common properties, the *General* tab in the ‘Text Input Properties’ panel provides the following properties.

Submit on Change::	When enabled (default), submits the entered value when user presses ‘Enter’ or clicks away. Otherwise, a separate ‘Submit’ button is required.
Refresh Dashboard after Submit::	Force the dashboard to refresh when the user submits a value from the Form component.
Placeholder Text:: 	Specifies the text to appear within the TextInput field whenever *no text* has been entered. (This is often a hint to the user about what data they should enter, for example, "`Enter the employee name`".) The placeholder text is automatically removed when the user begins entering data, and is never  submitted as the value of the TextInput component.
Default Text::	Specifies the default text to appear within the TextInput field. If '`Default Text`' is specified,  the '`Placeholder Text`' is  not shown.  If the '`Default Text`' is not subsequently modified by the user, it will be submitted as the value of the TextInput component.
Inset Border Style::	Specifies a dimensional “inset” (rather than flat) appearance for the component border.
Multiple Lines::	When enabled, allows the user to enter multiple lines of text into the text area.

== Option Tab
The *Option* tab in the ‘TextInput Properties’ panel allows you to select an *Input Editor* which specifies the control interface and validation for user input. See xref:WriteBackToStorage.adoc#ValidateUserInput[Validate User Input] for details on the available editors.

== Script Tab
