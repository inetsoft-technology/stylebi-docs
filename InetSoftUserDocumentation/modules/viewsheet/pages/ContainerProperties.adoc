The ‘Container Properties’ panel provides *General*, *Advanced*, and *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the Container-specific properties available under these tabs.

== General Tab
The *General* tab in the ‘Container Properties’ panel is the same as that for the *Image* component, and allows you also to specify an image to be used as the group background. See xref:ImageProperties.adoc[] for details on how to select the image.

== Advanced Tab
The *Advanced* tab in the ‘Container Properties’ panel is the same as that for the *Image* component, and allows you to set the scaling properties of the group background image. See xref:ImageProperties.adoc[] for details on image scaling.
