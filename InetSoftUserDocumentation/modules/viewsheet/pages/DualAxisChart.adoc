= Dual Axis Chart

include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]



By default, when you add two or more *measure* fields on the Y-axis, the selected datasets are plotted on adjacent sets of axes, as shown below in the Chart Editor:

In some cases, you may want to use *dual Y-axes* to represent these measures, as shown below:

To display a dataset on the right-side (secondary) Y-axis, follow the steps below:

include::partial$chartNewbieTip.adoc[]

. Add multiple measures to the chart. (See xref:MultipleMeasureChart.adoc[] for additional details.)

. Press the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph} in the Chart Editor.

This places all measuress on the same Y-axis rather than on adjacent axes.
