= Add a KPI
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

The most common way to represent a Key Performance indicator (KPI) is by using a Gauge component for graphical representation or a Text component for digital representation. The following sections explain how to do this.

== Add a Gauge KPI
A Gauge component allows you to display a single aggregated value (for example, a grand total) in a visually prominent manner.

=== Add the Gauge Component
To add a Gauge component, follow the steps below:

. If necessary, create a new Dashboard.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewDashboardNote.adoc[]

. From the *Toolbox* panel, drag the Gauge component onto the Dashboard.

. From the data source at the top of the *Toolbox* panel, drag a *measure* onto the Gauge component. (A green highlight informs you when you can drop the field.)
+
include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]
+
image:agileDash42.png[]
+
This binds the measure to the Gauge component so that the component displays the aggregated value of the measure.

. Right-click on the Gauge component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Gauge Properties’ panel.

. Select the *General* tab of the ‘Gauge Properties’ panel, and choose a desired gauge face.

. Select the *Data* tab. From the 'Aggregate' menu, select the desired aggregation method.  *_Optional:_* To make the aggregate dynamic so that a user can change it, use the {buttonValueType}. (See xref:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for more details.)

. Press btn:[OK] to close the panel.

. Enlarge the component as desired by dragging on any of the component borders.

=== Set Gauge Ranges (Optional)
To set multiple ranges for a Gauge, follow the steps below:

. Right-click on the Gauge component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Gauge Properties’ panel.

. Open the *Advanced* tab. In the ‘Range’ panel you will see three editable drop-down lists.

. Enter a value for ‘Range 1 to’ and choose a color from the pop-up menu. This sets the region from the minimum value on the scale to the specified value.

. Enter a value into ‘Range 2 to’ and choose a color from the pop-up menu. This sets the region from the end of ‘Range 1’ to the specified value.

. Repeat the above steps to add any additional thresholds.

. *_Optional:_*  Select ‘Gradient’ to smoothly blend the zone colors.   You can  choose a color for the final blend as well.

. Press btn:[OK] to apply the ranges.

== Add a Text KPI
In addition to displaying static text (see xref:AddTextOrHTML.adoc[]), a Text component allows you to display a single aggregated value (for example, a grand total). To use a Text component to display aggregate data, follow the steps below:

. If necessary, create a new Dashboard.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewDashboardNote.adoc[]

. From the *Toolbox* panel, drag a Text component onto the Dashboard.  This creates a new Text component.

. From the data source at the top of the *Toolbox* panel, drag a *measure* onto the Text component. (A green outline informs you when you can drop the field.)
+
include::ROOT:partial$measureTip.adoc[]
+

+
This binds the measure to the Text component so that the component displays the aggregated value of the measure.

. *_Optional:_* Enlarge the Text component by dragging on any of the component borders.

. *_Optional:_* Click the Text component to select it, and select the *Format* tab in the left panel.  Style the text as desired. (See xref:VisualFormat.adoc[] and xref:DataFormat.adoc[] for more details.)

. Right-click the Text element, and select 'Properties' form the context menu. This opens the 'Text Properties' panel.

. Select the *Data* tab. From the 'Aggregate' menu, select the desired aggregation method.   To make the aggregate dynamic so that a user can change it, use the {buttonValueType}. See xref:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for more details.

. Press btn:[OK].





. *_Optional:_* To filter the aggregate data displayed in the KPI, right-click the Text component and select ‘Condition’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Condition’  panel. Enter the desired condition and press btn:[OK]. To filter out *null* values, you can use a condition such as `[Company][is not][equal to][null]`.
See xref:AddConditions.adoc[] for more information about conditions.
+
TIP: It is generally preferable to use Filter components for filtering purposes.  See xref:FilterDashboard.adoc[].

== Compute a KPI with Script

The easiest way to use a Gauge or Text component to display a KPI is to bind the Gauge or Text to an existing data field as described above. However, you can also compute a KPI using script.

There are several ways to do this:

Text or Gauge:: Create a calculated field (see xref:dataworksheet:CreateNewDataField.adoc[]), and bind the calculated field to the Gauge or Text in the usual way (see above).
Text Only:: Enter an expression for the ‘Text’ property on the *General* tab of the ‘Text Properties’ panel to aggregate the desired data. See xref:TextProperties.adoc[] for more information.
Text or Gauge:: Enter an expression on the  *Script* tab of the ‘Gauge Properties’ or ‘Text Properties’ panel to compute a desired value. Assign the computed value to keyword `value`. For example:
+
[source,javascript]
value = sum(Sales['Total'])
+
