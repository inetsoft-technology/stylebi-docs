To open the  ‘Chart Properties’ panel, right-click body of the chart, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions}  The ‘Chart Properties’ panel provides the following tabs: *General*, *Advanced*, *Line*, *Hierarchy*, *Script*.

[#GeneralTab]
== General Tab

The *General* tab in the ‘Chart Properties’ panel provides the following Chart-specific properties.

NOTE: {dynamicProperties}



Tip::
* *Tooltip*: Value is displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the corresponding chart area. To display custom HTML in the tooltip, see xref:AddTipsToChart.adoc[].
* *Data Tip View*: A Dashboard component is displayed when the mouse hovers over the chart area. The component is filtered based on the hover region. See xref:AddTipsToChart.adoc[] for more details.
* *Flyover Views*: Allows you to select a set of Dashboard components which will be adaptively filtered as the user hovers the mouse or clicks on the chart area. (Select ‘On Click Only’ if you want the filtered components to update when the user clicks.)  See  xref:DrillDownIntoData.adoc[] for more details.

== Advanced Tab
The *Advanced* tab in the ‘Chart Properties’ panel provides the following properties. The available properties depend on the Chart type; some properties are not available for certain chart types.  (See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for information on how to select the Chart type.)

image:Advanced Chart Tab_1.png[]


Glossy Effect:: Applies a 3D effect to the Chart as a whole. (Not available for all Chart styles.)
Sparkline:: Hides all axes and legends. For a line chart, the ‘Sparkline’ also adds a point to the end of the line, and for a bar chart, displays negative values in red.
Enable Ad Hoc Editing:: Allow end users to access the Chart Editor and edit the chart.
Enable Date Comparison:: Enables the Date Comparison feature for the Chart. See xref:CompareDataByDate.adoc[] for more details.
Enable Drilling:: Allows the user to drill up and down in date or dimension fields. See xref:DrillDownIntoData.adoc[] for more information.
Sort Others Last:: Available when ‘Group all others together’ is enabled for Top/Bottom ranking in the ‘Edit Dimension’ panel of the Chart Editor. (See xref:FilterTopBottomGroups.adoc[]  for information about dimension ranking). When enabled, this property places the ‘Others’ group _after_ all of the ranked groups, regardless of the specified dimension sorting.
Top N For Each {...}:: When enabled, specifies that the top-N filter for a dimension (see xref:FilterTopBottomGroups.adoc[]) should be relative to the parent dimension in a dimension hierarchy. (See xref:#HierachyTab[] for explicit hierarchy.)
+
****
*Example*: If the chart ‘X’ dimension is ‘Product Category’ and the ‘Color’ binding is ‘Product Name’, and you request “top 3” of ‘ProductName’, enable ‘Top N For Each Product Category’ to make the filter relative to the ‘Product Category’ grouping (yielding the top 3 products for each category). Leave the option disabled to filter ‘Product Name’ without respect to the ‘Product Category’ group.
****

Background:: The fill color of the plot area on the Chart.
Pareto Line Color:: The color of the cumulative total line when a field is bound in the ‘Color’ region. If there is no ‘Color’ binding, the Pareto line is the same color as the bars.
Alpha:: Sets transparency for the Chart elements. If disabled, the default transparency for the particular chart type is used.
Banding:: Adds alternating colored bands to a specified categorical or timescale axis. Select the desired band color from the color picker. The band ‘Size’ setting is an integer indicating the number of category groups (for a categorical axis) or the number of date groups (for a timescale axis) to be spanned by each band.
Explode Pie:: Displays a pie chart with small gaps between the slices.
Pie Ratio:: A value in the range [0.1,1] that determines the proportion of the plot area occupied by the pie. Similarly-sized Pie charts with the same ‘Pie Ratio’ setting will display pies having the same radius, which allows you to enforce consistency across multiple charts.
+
CAUTION: Large  ‘Pie Ratio’ settings may leave less space for the display of values on the Chart.
Show Values:: Displays the aggregate measure values on the chart. If the chart also possesses a ‘Text’ binding, then the values displayed by ‘Show Values’ and those displayed by the ‘Text’ binding appear on different lines. Use a ‘Text’ format to individually format the values. For example, if the top value represents a date and the bottom value represents a number, you can apply the following text format, using `\n` to separate lines:
+
 Date: {0,date,yyyy}\nAmount: {1,number,$#}
+
For a *Map-type* chart, ‘Show Values’ displays the geographic labels for all regions if there is no ‘Text’ binding.
+
NOTE: By default, measure values are also displayed as a *tooltip* when the user *hovers* the mouse over the chart. Tooltips are visible when the Dashboard is previewed or viewed in the Portal. See xref:#GeneralTab[] to customize the tooltip.
Apply Aesthetics to Source Nodes:: For *Network*, *Circular Network*, and *Tree* chart types, specifies that node ‘Color’ and ‘Size’ determined by ‘Target’ value should also be applied to source nodes that are not also target nodes.
Show Reference Line:: Displays horizontal and vertical reference lines when the user moves the mouse over a data point.
Stack Value:: Displays a single aggregate value for each primary (X-axis) grouping, rather than for each individual subseries grouping.
Keep Element in Plot:: Automatically extend the chart boundaries to display chart elements (including target lines) that exceed the specified axis maximum.
Font Scale:: For *Word Cloud* Charts only, multiplies the specified ‘Size’ setting to increase the maximum font size of words in the cloud.
Show Points:: For a *Line* and *Radar* chart, adds markers at the locations of the individual data points.
Show Lines:: For *Point*-type charts, displays line segments connecting the points on the chart. To display a fitted line, use the ‘Trend Line’ option instead. (See xref:#LineTab[].)
As One Line:: For Point-type charts with a dimension set in the *Color*, *Shape*, *Size*, or *Text* regions, connects the points with a *single line* rather than using separate lines for the different dimension values. Requires ‘Show Lines’ to be enabled.
Fill Missing Data with Dashed Line:: For *Line* and *Radar* charts, and for *Point* charts with ‘Show Lines’ enabled, linearly interpolates missing data using a dashed line.
Fill Time-Series Gaps:: When the ‘As time series’ option is set for a dimension, the ‘Fill Time-Series Gaps’ option specifies how missing data should be represented on the chart. (See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for information on how to edit a dimension.) When the option is disabled, plotted lines simply ignore the missing data and connect adjacent points. When the option is enabled, you can choose to represent gaps with either ‘Null’, which leaves an empty space at the location, or with ‘Zero’, which inserts a numerical value of 0 at the location.
Stack Measures:: Stacks multiple chart measures together. This may be desirable when the individual measures are fractions of some total. (Example: Component fees on a shipment, such as documentation, packaging, handling, etc.) This option is available only when there are multiple measures on the chart, the ‘Stack’ option is enabled from the {buttonSelectChartStyle}, and single-graph mode has been activated from the {buttonSwitchSingleGraph}.
Map Default Color:: For a *Map* Chart, sets the color for map regions that are not assigned a color based on data.
Always Show Color in Map:: For a *Map* Chart, when a column is bound to the ‘Color’ field of the *Visual* panel in the Chart Editor, this setting ensures that the color is always used to fill the map regions. Otherwise, if another column is simultaneously bound to the ‘Shape’, ‘Size’, or ‘Text’ fields of the *Visual* panel, the color generated for the ‘Color’ binding will be applied to the plotted points rather than to the map regions.
Levels:: Specifies the number of contours used to represent each region in a Scatter Contour or Contour Map Chart. A larger number produces a smoother transition of colors.
Bandwidth:: Specifies the area over which to calculate density for a  *Scatter Contour* or *Contour Map* Chart. A larger number produces contours that span larger areas.
Edge Alpha:: Specifies the transparency of the contour edge for a  *Scatter Contour* or *Contour Map* Chart. The transparency of the contour center is determined by the  Chart ‘Alpha’ property. A higher value makes the edges more visible.
Cell Size:: Specifies the size of the cells that make up the grid on which contour weights are computed for a  *Scatter Contour* or *Contour Map* Chart. Higher values specify larger cells, and hence broader clusters. Lower values specify smaller cells, and hence smaller clusters.
Target Lines:: Specify marker lines, bands, or statistical regions to be placed in the plot area. See xref:TrendCompareData.adoc[] for more information.

[#LineTab]
== Line Tab
The *Line* tab in the ‘Chart Properties’ panel provides the following chart-specific properties. The properties shown depend on the chart style.  See xref:BasicChartingSteps.adoc[] for information on how to set the Chart style.

image:Line Chart Tab.png[]

X Grid:: The line style and color of the X-axis grid.
Y Grid:: The line style and color of the Y-axis grid.
Quadrant Grid:: The style and color for a set of perpendicular line segments which divide the plot area into quadrants.
Diagonal Line:: The style and color for a line segment which originates in the lower-left corner of the plot area and terminates in the upper-right corner of the plot area.
Show Table Grid:: For a facet-type chart (i.e., a chart with both a *measure* and *dimension* on the same axis or with multiple dimensions on the same axis), displays a solid line around the entire plot area and displays a solid axis line to separate the dimension and measure axis labels.  See xref:HybridTableChart.adoc[] for an example of this kind of Chart.
+
include::ROOT:partial$measureAndDimensionTip.adoc[]
+
Use the adjacent color chip to select the color for the line surrounding the plot area. To set the color of the axis separator line, right-click on the line and select ‘Axis Properties’ from the context menu. See  xref:AxisProperties.adoc[] for details about setting the axis color.
Trend Line:: Specifies whether an interpolated trend line is displayed, and the method by which the trend line should be fit to the data (linear, quadratic, etc.). The ‘Trend Line Style’ menu and color chip specify the trend line style and color. The ‘Default’ option indicates that the style should match the corresponding measure line. If there are multiple *measures* or if there is a *dimension* associated with the chart’s ‘Color’ binding, select the ‘One Per Color’ option to create an independent trend line for each color group. (The trend line colors are matched to the corresponding data colors unless you explicitly specify a trend line color.)
+
include::ROOT:partial$measureAndDimensionTip.adoc[]
+
Use the ‘For Measures’ menu to select a subset of measures for which to display trend lines.

Project Forward:: Specifies the number of axis units that the trend line should extend beyond the final data point.  Projection requires that axis values be a linear and complete series of either numbers or dates.

[WARNING,caption=See Also]
====
xref:DrillDownIntoData.adoc[], for information on using default drill-down features.
====
The *Hierarchy* tab in the ‘Chart Properties’ dialog box allows you to specify the hierarchy for a custom drill-down. To create a custom drill-down hierarchy, follow the steps below:




. Right-click the Chart, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Chart Properties’ panel.

. Select the *Hierarchy* tab. The ‘Columns’ panel displays the fields available in the Chart’s binding.
+
image:Hierarchy Chart Tab.png[]

. Click on a field that you want to include in the hierarchy, and drag the field to the ‘Hierarchy’ panel.


. *_Optional:_*  If the added field is a date field, select the desired date representation from options below the ‘Hierarchy’ panel.
+
TIP: Drilling on date fields is enabled by default. Use the *Hierarchy* tab to _customize_ the drill sequence, as shown below.

+
image:Chart Properties Add Hierarchy3.png[]
+
After you add a date field to the ‘Hierarchy’ panel, the date field still remains available in the ‘Columns’ panel. This allows you to add the same date field to the hierarchy at multiple levels, giving each level a different date representation. In this way, you can control the date-drilling sequence. For example, the following hierarchy produces the drill-down sequence menu:Year[Month > Day].
+
image:Chart Properties Add Hierarchy4.png[]

. Click on another field that you want to include in the hierarchy, and drag it over the existing fields in the ‘Hierarchy’ panel. Drop the field into the desired position in the hierarchy.
+
image:Chart Properties Add Hierarchy.png[]

. Repeat the previous step to add additional fields to the hierarchy, as desired.

. To remove a specific field from the hierarchy, simply drag the field from the ‘Hierarchy’ panel back to the ‘Columns’ panel. To remove _all_ fields from the hierarchy, press the btn:[Clear] button.

. *_Optional:_*  To create an additional independent hierarchy, drag a field from the ‘Columns’ panel to the region labeled ‘Drag here to add a hierarchy’. Then repeat the previous steps to add additional fields to this independent hierarchy.
+
image:Chart Properties Add Hierarchy2.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the panel.

Note that there may not be any immediate change to the Chart. However, by configuring a hierarchy as described above,  when you (or the end user) adds a field listed on the hierarchy to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region of the Chart Editor, the Chart will automatically implement an appropriate drill-down feature based on the specified hierarchy.

.Example: Dimension  Hierarchy
****
Consider the following hierarchy: menu:Category[Name>Company]. After you have specified this hierarchy in the ‘Hierarchy’ panel, if you then bind the ‘Category’ field to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region in the Chart Editor, the Chart automatically makes a full drill-down hierarchy (menu:Category[Name>Company]) available to users. Likewise, if you bind the ‘Name’ field to the ‘X’ or ‘Y’ region in the Chart Editor, the Chart automatically makes the appropriate partial drill-down hierarchy (menu:Name[Company]) available to users.
****

== Script Tab
The *Script* tab is common to all components.  (See xref:ScriptTab.adoc[].)  However, Charts provide many special scripting properties.  See xref:chartAPI:ChartScriptTutorial.adoc[] and xref:chartAPI:ChartScriptReference.adoc[] for more details on Chart scripting.
