In some cases you may want to create a *grid of charts*, where different charts represent different values of a particular *dimension* (‘Region’ and ‘Category’ in the chart below).

To create a grid of charts, simply add dimensions into the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ regions to create the desired arrangement. For example, to break out the ‘Region’ dimension on the X-axis and the ‘Category’ dimension on the Y-axis, place these fields as shown below in the Chart Editor.
