image:viewsheetExp1_1.png[]
+
If you select a data model or table as the data source, your Dashboard will have access to all the fields in the selected data source. If you select a Data Worksheet as the data source, the Dashboard will have access to all the data blocks in the selected Data Worksheet. To add a derived data field to the fields already available in the selected data source, see xref:dataworksheet:CreateNewDataField.adoc[].
+
NOTE: If you do not want to use the Dashboard Wizard (see below), you do not need to specify a data source at this time. (See xref:DashboardOptions.adoc[] to choose a data source at a later time.)
. Choose how you want to start building your Dashboard, by using the Dashboard Wizard or the Visual Composer.
+
* xref:UseDashboardWizard[]
* xref:UseVisualComposer[]

The *Dashboard Wizard* helps you set up your Dashboard by suggesting appropriate ways to visualize your data. If you do not want to use the Wizard, you can proceed to *Visual Composer* and build your Dashboard there.
