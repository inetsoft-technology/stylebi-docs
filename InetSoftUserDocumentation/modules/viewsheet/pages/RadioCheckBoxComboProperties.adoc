The ‘Properties’ panel for Radio Button, Check Box, or Combo Box provides *General*, *Data*, and  *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the Form-specific properties available under these tabs.


== General Tab
The *General* tab in the ‘Properties’ panel provides the following unique properties for Radio Button, Check Box, and Combo Box.

Submit on Change:: When enabled (default), submits the selected value immediately upon selection. Otherwise, a separate ‘Submit’ button is required.
Refresh Dashboard after Submit:: Force the dashboard to refresh when the user submits a value from the Form component.
List Values:: Specifies the method for populating control labels and values.  You can select one or both of the following.  If you specify both, the results are merged.
* *Embedded*: Manually enter label-value pairs. For Date or TimeInstant type data, select the ‘Calendar’ option to allow users to select values using a calendar interface.  Enter the ‘Minimum Date’ and ‘Maximum Date’ to restrict the range of the calendar. For TimeInstant data, select ‘Server Time Zone’ to utilize server time rather than client time.
* *Query*: Populate from a query (data block). See xref:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for information on how to use these options.

+
*_Optional_*: To specify a default value, *disable* the '`No Default`' option, and choose the desired default from the '`Default Value`' menu. In the case where the values and labels differ, the menu displays items as `label|value`.

Sort:: Specifies the sort order of the items, ‘Ascending’ or ‘Descending’. Enable ‘List Embedded Items Last’ to force items set via the ‘Embedded List Values’ dialog box to the end of the list (i.e., following any query-retrieved items).
Editable:: Allows the user to enter an arbitrary string into the Combo Box (in addition to selecting from the list options).
Select First Item:: For Check Box, selects the first item when the Dashboard loads (if no items are preselected).
