Reverse:: Orient the scale with maximum at left, minimum at right (or maximum represented by smallest, minimum represented by largest, etc.).
Include Zero:: For a ‘Size’ legend, specifies that zero should be included in the scaling such that the (hypothetical) minimum element size corresponds to a value of zero rather than the actual minimum data value.
