The Shape component’s ‘Properties’ dialog box provides *General*, *Shape*, and *Script* tabs. The next sections discuss the component-specific properties available under these tabs.

== General Tab
No special properties are available: {commonGeneral}

== Shape Tab
The *Shape* tab in the ‘Properties’ dialog box for shape components provides slightly different properties for each shape type, as explained below.

TIP: {dynamicProperties}

Line: Style, Line: Color::	Sets the line type (thickness, etc.) and color for shape borders. Available for all shapes.
Fill: Color, Fill: Alpha::	Sets the color and transparency of Oval and Rectangle shape interiors. An ‘Alpha’ value of 100% indicates complete opacity. An ‘Alpha’ value of less that 100% allows underlying components to be partially visible through the shape.
Shape: Round Corners::	Sets the radius (in pixels) for circularized corners on Rectangle shapes. Larger pixel values yield more gentle corners.
Gradient::	Sets a gradient fill for Rectangle and Oval shapes. See xref:AddBackground.adoc[] for instructions on how to build a gradient.

== Script Tab
{commonScript}
