====
xref:AddFilterComponents.adoc[], for the recommended approach to filtering your data in most cases.
====

You can filter the values displayed in a Data View component (Chart, Table, Crosstab) or Output component (Gauge, Text) to match specified criteria by setting a _Condition_ on the component. For example, you can filter a Chart or a Table so that it displays only data for a particular sales employee or region.

IMPORTANT: Condition-based filtering applies on the *component level*, and is different from filtering provided by Filter components such as Selection Lists and Range Sliders (see xref:AddFilterComponents.adoc[].) Filter components filter the Dashboard’s underlying  data block and therefore affect _all_ Data View and Output elements in the Dashboard that use the same  data block. In contrast, a Condition that you place on a particular component affects only that component.

To apply a Condition to a Data View or Output component, follow these steps:

. Right-click the element, and select ‘Conditions’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Conditions’ dialog box.

. Select the operand and type of comparison from the menus at the top of the dialog box, for example, `[Company][is not][one of]`.
+
TIP: Note: To filter out *null* values, you can use a condition such as `[Company][is not][equal to][null]`.


. Press the {buttonChangeValueType}, and select ‘Value’, ‘Field’, ‘Expression’, ‘Variable’, or ‘Session Data’.

* If you select the ‘Field’ option, in the adjoining menu, choose the column for comparison. (The two columns will be compared row by row; rows that satisfy the condition will be preserved.)

* If you select the ‘Value’ option, either enter the comparison value into the provided text field, or select ‘Browse Data’ to choose the comparison value from a list. (For the `[one of]` operator, {buttonCtrl}-click in the ‘Browse Data’ list to select multiple items.)

* If you select the ‘Variable’ option, select one of the Form components listed in the menu to provide the value at runtime. (See xref:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for further details.)

[TIP]
====
If you are using the `[in range]` operator for a date field condition, the value assigned to the variable should be one of the permissible range strings, such as ‘Last Year’, ‘This Year’, etc.

You can also enter an arbitrary variable name (one which does not correspond to an existing Form component). In this case, the user will be prompted at runtime to enter a value for the parameter.  See xref:#ControlUserPrompting[] below for more information about prompting.


* If you select the ‘Expression’ option, press the btn:[JS]/btn:[SQL] button to select JavaScript or SQL syntax, and then press the {buttonEditExpression}. This opens the Script Editor where you can enter your expression. (See xref:dataworksheet:CreateNewDataField.adoc[] for details on using expressions.)

* If you select the ‘Session Data’ option, choose one of ‘User’, ‘Roles’, or ‘Groups’. These parameters return information about the user who is currently viewing the Dashboard; respectively, the user name, the array of roles to which the user belongs, and the array of groups to which the user belongs.
+
NOTE: The adjacent menu automatically chooses the `[equal to]` or `[one of]` operator to match your selection.

. When you have fully specified the condition, press btn:[Append].

. To create a compound condition with multiple clauses, repeat Steps 2-4 above, using the `[and]` and `[or]` operators to compose the condition clauses. See below:
+
include::ROOT:partial$compoundCondition.adoc[]

. Press btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Condition’ dialog box. The component will now only display data that  satisfies the Condition.

[#ControlUserPrompting]
== Control User Prompting
By default, a Dashboard will prompt the user for all parameters in the linked  data source (Data Worksheet, etc.) that have not already been assigned a value. In some cases, you may want to suppress the prompting for some or all of these parameters.

=== Suppress Prompting for All Parameters
To suppress prompting for ALL parameters, follow these steps:

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

. *Disable* the ‘Prompt for Parameters’ option.
+
image:OptionsPromptForParameters.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box.

=== Supress Prompting for Some Paramaters
To suppress prompting SOME parameters, follow these steps:

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.
. Press the btn:[Customize] button next to the ‘Prompt for Parameters’ option.
+
image:Viewsheet Options Customize.png[]
+
This open the ‘Customize Parameters’ dialog box.

. To disable one or more parameters, select the parameters you wish to disable in the ‘Enabled Parameters’ panel, and press the btn:[Add] button. This moves the selected parameters to the ‘Disabled Parameters’ panel.
+
image:CustomizeParametersDialog.png[]
+
To re-enable one or more disabled parameters, select the parameters you wish to enable in the ‘Disabled Parameters’ panel, and press the btn:[Remove] button. This moves the selected parameters to the ‘Enabled Parameters’ panel.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Customize Parameters’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.
