The measure is represented in terms of the “box” (lower quartile, median, upper quartile), “whiskers” (minimum and maximum, excluding outliers), and individual outliers. An outlier is a value that is less than the lower quartile or greater than the upper quartile by more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range.
