== Use Shape or Image as Background
You can use an Image or a Shape component as a background for any portion of a Dashboard. For example, you can place an Image behind a set of components to provide the appearance of a frame or panel.

To use an Image or a Shape as a background, follow the steps below:

. Add an Image or a Shape component to the Dashboard.

. For an *Image component*, follow the steps below:

.. Right-click the Image component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ dialog box.

.. Under the *General* tab, expand the ‘Skin’ folder and select the desired skin, or press ‘Upload’ to upload your own image file to the server (JPEG, GIF, SVG, PNG, TIFF).

.. *_Optional:_* Select the *Advanced* tab.  Check the ‘Scale Image’ box, and select either ‘Maintain Aspect Ratio’ or ‘Scale (9-Cell Grid)’ option. The ‘Maintain Aspect Ratio’ option keeps the original image proportions as the image is scaled. The ‘Scale (9-Cell Grid)’ allows the interior of the image to scale without scaling the border around the image.
+
When using the default skins, select ‘Scale (9-Cell Grid)’ and enter “1” in each of the ‘Top’, ‘Right’, ‘Bottom’, and ‘Left’ fields.

.. Select the *Shape* tab. Make the desired ‘Line’ and ‘Fill’ settings.

TIP: Locking the component is useful when you are laying out other components on top of the Image or Shape. When the background Image or Shape is locked, you can easily move the top components without disturbing the position of the background. To unlock the component, right-click and select ‘Unlock’. {rightClickOptions}

You can continue to place other components on top of this background image.
