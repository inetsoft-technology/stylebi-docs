To create a Marimekko  chart, follow the basic steps below:

include::partial$chartNewbieTip.adoc[]

To create a Marimekko chart, place a *dimension* in the ‘X’ region of the Chart Editor to create the X-axis labels, and place the desired Mekko category *dimension* in the ‘Color’ or ‘Break By’ region of the Chart Editor. The Mekko category dimension determines the grouping in each column of the chart.

NOTE: To create a grid of charts, place dimensions into the ‘X’ and/or ‘Y’ regions as well. See xref:TrellisChartGrid.adoc[] for more information.
