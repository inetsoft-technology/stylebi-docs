The ‘Image Properties’ panel provides the following tabs: *General*, *Advanced*, *Data*,  *Script*. The next sections discuss the Image-specific properties available under these tabs.

[#GeneralTab]
== General Tab
The *General* tab in the ‘Image Properties’ dialog box provides the following image-specific properties.

TIP: {dynamicProperties}


Static Image:: Select an existing server image, or press btn:[Upload] to upload an image to the server. The ‘Skins’ folder provides a few predefined images which are useful as backgrounds. The ‘Theme Background’ has the special property of automatically adapting to match the prevailing color scheme of the User Portal.
+
IMPORTANT: All images uploaded to the Image component will be sent to the client browser and held in memory, even if they are not being displayed.
+
‘Alpha’ sets the transparency of image. An ‘Alpha’ value of 100% indicates complete opacity. An ‘Alpha’ value of less that 100% allows underlying components to be partially visible through the image.

Tooltip:: Value of bound data aggregate is displayed as tooltip when mouse hovers over the component. To display custom HTML in the tooltip, see xref:AddTipsToChart.adoc[].

Shadow:: Adds a drop shadow to the component.

== Data Tab
{commonData} The ‘Aggregate’ value that you specify here is used as the value for the Image highlight condition. (See xref:ConditionalFormat.adoc[] for more information about highlights.)

== Advanced Tab

The *Advanced* tab in the ‘Image Properties’ dialog box provides the following Image-specific properties.

Dynamic Image Selection:: Specifies a method for dynamically setting the image. See xref:viewsheetscript:ChangeImageWithScript.adoc[] in xref:viewsheetscript:AdvancedDashboardScripting.adoc[] , for more information.
Scale Image:: When selected, specifies that images should be scaled to the containing component boundary. The following options are available:
* *Maintain Aspect Ratio*: The image’s width to height ratio is preserved when the image is resized, preventing the image from being distorted.
* *Scale (9-Cell Grid)*: The image is divided into nine regions, which scale independently. See xref:AddBackground.adoc[] for more information about 9-cell scaling.
Tile:: Tiles (repeats) the image horizontally and vertically within the component boundaries.
Preview:: Displays a thumbnail of the image as it will appear with the applied scaling.
Pop Component:: Select an individual component or group Container to display as a pop-up interface when the user clicks the image. (See '`Pop Location`' below to set the location.) Otherwise, the selected component is not visible in the Dashboard.
+
‘Alpha’ sets the transparency of the pop-up component or group. An ‘Alpha’ value of 100% indicates complete opacity. An ‘Alpha’ value of less that 100% allows underlying components to be partially visible through the popped-up component or group.
Pop Location:: The location where the pop component appears, either where the mouse was clicked or at the center of the screen.
