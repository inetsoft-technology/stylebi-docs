The ‘Running’ calculation allows you to express each group aggregate as an accumulation of previous aggregate values in the series. The method of accumulation is specified by the ‘Aggregate’ menu in the ‘Calculation’ dialog box.

The ‘Reset at’ option, available for date fields, allows you to specify the date interval (e.g., year, quarter, week, etc.) at which the accumulation should be cleared.

.Example: Running Average
****
In this example, you will create a chart that computes total quantities sold by month, and displays these values as a running average. The running average will be reset on a yearly basis.

Follow the steps below:


. Create a new Dashboard based on the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]
+
include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]


. Drag a Chart component onto the Dashboard, and enlarge the Chart as desired by dragging the handles.

. Press the {buttonEdit} at the top-right of the Chart to open the Visualization Recommender. Bypass the Recommender by pressing the {buttonFullEditor} at the top right. This opens the Chart Editor.

. In the Chart Editor, from the ‘Dimensions’ node in the data source, drag the ‘Date’ dimension to the ‘X’ region.

. From the ‘Measures’ node in the data source, drag the ‘Quantity Purchased’ measure to the ‘Y’ region.

. Press the {buttonEditDimension} next to the ‘Date’ measure.

. From the ‘Level’ menu select ‘Month’, and press the {buttonApply}. This groups the date data (i.e., X-axis labels) by month.
