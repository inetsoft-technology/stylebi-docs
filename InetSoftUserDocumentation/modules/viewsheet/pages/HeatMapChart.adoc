A heat map displays a *measure* using a colored grid, where the value of the aggregated measure for a given combination of *dimension* values is used to determine the color of the grid at that location.
include::ROOT:partial$measureAndDimensionTip.adoc[]
To create a heat map, place the desired dimensions on the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ axes, and place the desired measure in the ‘Color’ region of the Chart Editor.

IMPORTANT: Do not place any measures on the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ axes, and do not place any fields in the ‘Size’ and ‘Shape’ regions of the Chart Editor.
