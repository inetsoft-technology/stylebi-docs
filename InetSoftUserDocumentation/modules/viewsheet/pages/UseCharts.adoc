Charts provide many features for customization and exploration. These features are described in the sections below.  After you modify a Chart, you can save your changes (if desired) in one of the following ways:

* Save the entire Dashboard (if you have appropriate permissions).  See xref:SavePublicDashboard.adoc[].
* Save the Chart as an Image. See xref:ExportDashboard.adoc#ExportChartImage[Export a Chart as an Image] in xref:ExportDashboard.adoc[].
* Save a new *bookmark* that contains the  Chart modifications.  See xref:user:BookmarkDashboard.adoc[].
* Export the entire Dashboard.  See xref:ExportDashboard.adoc[].

== Chart Toolbar
TIP: If the Chart mini-toolbar obscures Chart data, press the {buttonHideMiniToolbar} to temporarily hide it.

The mini-toolbar at the top of a Chart often provides a variety of tools for navigating and adapting the Chart.  The table below lists the options that you might see in the toolbar.  Some options are available only when you select data on the Chart.
