The  list below explains the five icons used in Selection Lists and Selection Trees:

.Selection Icons
****
{buttonSelectionListSelected}:: *Data selected and included.* You have explicitly selected this item, and the corresponding records are included in the returned data set.

{buttonSelectionListNotIncluded}:: *Data selected but not included*. You have explicitly selected this item, but more recent explicit selections in other Selection Lists have now made this selection *incompatible*. The corresponding data is therefore _not_ included in the returned data set.

{buttonSelectionListSelectedAuto}:: *Data included but not selected.* You have not explicitly selected this item, but have made other selections that _implicitly_ select this item as well. The corresponding records are included in the returned data set (as a result of those other selections).  To explicitly select all of the “included” items, right-click on the Selection List and choose ‘Select All’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions}

{buttonSelectionListEmpty}:: *Data compatible but not included*. You have not explicitly selected this item, and the item remains *compatible* with existing user selections. This item can therefore be selected to add additional records to the returned data set.

{buttonSelectionListExcluded}:: *Data incompatible*. You have not explicitly selected this item, and this item is *incompatible* with existing selections. (It appears listed under ‘Others’). Selecting this _clears_ all other selections and starts fresh.
