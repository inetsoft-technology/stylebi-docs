Specifies the pixel location or proportional location where the shape is placed. (Positive values specify distance from left/bottom. Negative values specify distance from right/top.)  The corresponding “getter” function is `getPoint()`.

== Parameter
value::			a subclass of {javaawtgeomPoint2D} +
(e.g., {javaawtPoint} for pixels, {javaawtgeomPoint2DDouble} for proportion)


== Example


.Chart Component Script
[source,javascript]
--
include::scriptexample:partial$ShapeFormSetPoint1.js[]
--
<1> {dataset}
<2> Create the  xref:ShapeForm.adoc[] object.
<3> Use `setPoint()` to set `shape1` points in pixels.
<4> Use `setPoint()` to set `shape2` points proportionally.
<5> Use xref:EGraphAddForm.adoc[] to add the `GraphForm` to the Chart.

[TIP]
=====
To change the property on a Chart that was previously created with the Chart Editor, you do not need to add a Chart element. For example:

[source,javascript]

include::scriptexample:partial$ShapeFormSetPoint2.js[]
