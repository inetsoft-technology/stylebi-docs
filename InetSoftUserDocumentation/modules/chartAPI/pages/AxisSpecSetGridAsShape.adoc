include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]




Specifies whether axis grid lines are represented as shapes or positions. If represents as shapes, the grid lines can be transformed into curves under a coordinate transformation (for example, transformation of rectangular to polar coordinates). Otherwise, the grid lines remain straight, and only the endpoints are transformed.



== Parameter
Boolean:: `true`: grid lines represented as shape (default) +
`false`: grid lines represented as position
