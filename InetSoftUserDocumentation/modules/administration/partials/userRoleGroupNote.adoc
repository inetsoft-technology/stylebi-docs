The following are some rules which govern users, roles and groups:
[square]
* Users, groups, and roles are defined independently for different *organizations* if  multi-tenancy is enabled.  The exceptions are the *Administrator* role and *Organization Administrator* role, which are predefined and global. See xref:administration:EnableMultiTenant.adoc[] for more information.   If multi-tenancy is not enabled, all users, groups, and roles belong to the Host Organization.


* Groups and Roles are independent, i.e., you do not have to define both groups and roles in your system. You can have  one or the other, or both.



* A user can belong to more than one group.

* A user can have multiple roles.

* An entire group can be assigned one or more roles.

* A role can be applied to one or more groups.

* A role can inherit all the permissions from another role.

* Permissions to  assets  can be assigned directly to users, groups, and roles.

* When troubleshooting user problems, it is often useful for the administrator to log into the Portal as a particular user. See xref:LoginAsDifferentUser.adoc[]. This allows the administrator to experience the application environment as the user experiences it, which makes it easier to replicate the userâ€™s problem.
