IMPORTANT: Passwords for external services such as databases and LDAP servers  are securely encrypted using a password-derived key. To change the password, run the `:security change-master-password` command from the *Administration Console*. (See xref:AutomateAdminTasks.adoc[].) Use the system Environment Variable `INETSOFT_MASTER_PASSWORD` to provide the password (default: `success123`) to the InetSoft application. If you set `INETSOFT_MASTER_PASSWORD` before you run the application the first time, the `INETSOFT_MASTER_PASSWORD` password is used instead of the default.
