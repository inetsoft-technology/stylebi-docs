An *organization* is assigned to a user when multi-tenancy is enabled (see xref:EnableMultiTenant.adoc[]), and the URL used  to access the StyleBI server provides the organization ID.  When an organization is identified in the URL, the users, groups, and roles  specified for that organization will be in effect for the session.

Users within an organization only have access to assets scoped for that organization, although individual access can be restricted further  through the assignment of permissions.  (See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[].)

IMPORTANT:  *Organization Administrator* is a role that grants  administrator  privileges to a user within the user`'s specific  organization.   *Site Administrator* is a role that grants a user system-wide administrator  privileges,  including access to all organizations and system settings.

This opens the '`New Organization`' dialog box.


. In the '`Clone From Existing Organization`' menu, choose an existing organization from which you want to copy settings such as identities, permissions, organization-scoped properties, and  assets (Dashboards, Data Worksheets, data sources).  The '`Host Organization`' is the default organization that is administered by the Site Administrator. Select '`None`' to create  the organization without preexisting settings.

NOTE: To ensure security, you may  be prompted to confirm that you want to proceed with cloning.

This creates an organization with a default name ‘organizationN’ (organization0, organization1, etc.).
