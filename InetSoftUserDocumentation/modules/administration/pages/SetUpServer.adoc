= Set Up Server
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]
include::ROOT:partial$enterpriseOnly.adoc[]

If the server is running, it is best to manage server properties and storage using Enterprise Manager as described in xref:AllProperties.adoc[] and xref:Storage.adoc[]. However, if the server is not running, you can set up the server in script by using the `:setup`  or equivalent `:su` command.

include::partial$runCommand.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: To connect to a non-running server, you will need to launch the Administration Console with  appropriate flags.  See xref:ConnectToRepository.adoc[].

// Documentation #67942 SAYS THIS IS DELETED ***********
== Convert SREE Home to New Storage Format
The `upgrade-storage` action converts the SREEÂ Home (server repository) of from the format of version 2021 and earlier to the new storage structure of version 2022 and later. See https://www.inetsoft.com/wiki/bin/view/Main/HowToUpgrade2022[How to Upgrade to 2022] for detailed instructions on upgrading to version 2022.

=== Parameters
oldSREEHome:: Absolute path to *SREE Home* of the previous version
newSREEHome:: Absolute path to new *SREE Home*, which should be an empty directory

//include::ROOT:partial$SREEHome.adoc[]

=== Example
[source,groovy]
:setup upgrade-storage 'C:/ProgramData/InetSoft\ Technology/InetSoft/2021/server-config' 'C:/NewSREEHome'
////

== Set a Property
The `set-property` action sets a specified server property.

=== Parameters
directory:: Path to *SREE Home*
property:: Name of the property to set
value:: Value of the property

//include::ROOT:partial$SREEHome.adoc[]

=== Example
[source,groovy]
 :setup set-property '/var/lib/inetsoft' 'license.key' 'S000-000-ERX-000000000000000-000000000000'

This can also be used in script form:

[source,groovy]
inetsoft {
  setup('/var/lib/inetsoft') {
    properties {
      put 'license.key', 'S000-000-ERX-000000000000000-000000000000'
    }
  }
}



== Get a Property
The `get-property` action gets a specified server property.

=== Parameters
directory:: Path to *SREE Home*
property:: Name of the property to get

//include::ROOT:partial$SREEHome.adoc[]

=== Example
[source,groovy]
:setup get-property '/var/lib/inetsoft' 'license.key'

This can also be used in script form:

[source,groovy]
inetsoft {
  setup('/var/lib/inetsoft') {
    properties {
      get(license.key)
    }
  }
}


[#UploadFilestoStorage]
== Upload Files to Storage
The `upload-file`  action allows you to move files into server storage. (See xref:ManageContent.adoc[] for information about importing to the repository.) {connectRepositoryNote}

=== Parameters
directory:: Path to SREE Home
file:: Path to local file
targetPath:: Desired location of file in server storage. This is the path displayed on the *Storage* page in Enterprise Manager. (See xref:Storage.adoc[] for more information.)

//include::ROOT:partial$SREEHome.adoc[]

=== Example

[source,groovy]
:setup upload-file '/var/lib/inetsoft' '/arbitrary/container/path/uploadFile.txt' 'path_in_dataspace/text.txt'


This can also be accomplished in a DSL script using the `write`  method. The `write` method parameters are the target storage path and the file to upload.

[source,groovy]
inetsoft {
  setup('/path_to_sree_home') {
  storage {
    write('data_space/text.txt', new File('/arbitrary/container/path/uploadFile.txt'))
  }
}



== Download Files from Storage
The `download-file`  action allows you to move files out of server storage. (See xref:ManageContent.adoc[] for information about exporting from the repository.) {connectRepositoryNote}

=== Parameters
directory:: Path to SREE Home
sourcePath:: Path to file in server storage. This is the path displayed on the *Storage* page in Enterprise Manager. (See xref:Storage.adoc[] for more information.)
files:: Path to local file to be written

//include::ROOT:partial$SREEHome.adoc[]

=== Example

[source,groovy]
:setup download-file '/var/lib/inetsoft' 'path_in_dataspace/text.txt' '/arbitrary/container/path/downloadedFile.txt'


This can also be accomplished in a DSL  script using the  `read` method.  The `read` method parameters are  the server storage path and a closure with an `InputStream` as the parameter.

[source,groovy]
inetsoft {
  setup('/var/lib/inetsoft') {
  storage {
    read('path_in_dataspace/text.txt') { inp ->
      // opens a new file output stream and copies the input stream to it
      new File('/arbitrary/container/path/downloadedFile.txt').withCloseable { it << inp }
    }
  }
}


== Restore Assets to Server
The `restore` action restores backed-up server storage from a Zip file.   To backup assets to Zip file, see xref:ManageContent.adoc[]. {connectRepositoryNote}

CAUTION: The server should not be running during the restore operation.


=== Parameter
path:: The path to the local Zip file that contains the backed-up files.

=== Example
Restore server storage from _backup.zip_.

[source,groovy]
:setup restore '/var/lib/inetsoft' '/arbitrary/container/path/backup.zip'


== List Drivers
The `list-drivers` action returns a list of drivers contained in the specified JAR file, which should be uploaded as described in xref:#UploadFilestoStorage[]. {connectRepositoryNote}

=== Parameter
jarFiles:: A JAR file in the bin directory containing drivers.

=== Example
[source,groovy]
import inetsoft.shell.dsl.SetupDelegate
:setup list-drivers '/arbitrary/container/path/ojdbc6-11.2.0.4.jar'


== Package Drivers as a Plugin
The `create-driver-plugin` packages database drivers into a plugin Zip file with the specified name. {connectRepositoryNote}

=== Parameter
pluginID:: A unique ID, typically be a namespaced value, such as `com.mycompany.jdbc.dbtype`.
pluginName:: A desired name for the plugin. The plugin will be listed under this name in Enterprise Manager.
pluginVersion:: The plugin version, which should conform to https://semver.org/[semantic versioning standards].
drivers:: The class name of the driver to package.
jarFile:: The JAR file containing the driver, which should be located in the _bin_ directory of the installation.
zipFile:: The Zip file in which the plugin should be saved.

=== Example
[source,groovy]
:setup create-driver-plugin 'com.mycompany.jdbc.dbtype' 'myDB' '1.1.1' 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver' '/arbitrary/container/path/ojdbc6-11.2.0.4.jar' '/arbitrary/container/path/ojdbc6-11.2.0.4.jar.zip'
