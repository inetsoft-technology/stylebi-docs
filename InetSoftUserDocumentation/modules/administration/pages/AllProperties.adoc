[#LimitsandSafeguards]
== Limits and Safeguards
The following table lists a variety of limits and safeguards. See xref:TailorServerPerformance.adoc[] for related properties.

ways.warn.joinMaxRows:: If set to `false` (default), the user will be shown a single warning for the session when the `join.table.maxrows` limit is violated. (See below.) Set to `true` to warn the user for each individual violation.
asset.max.idle:: Sets the duration (in milliseconds) that a Dashboard remains active in the Portal when no user interactions are detected. Default is 2 hours (7,200,000 milliseconds). There is no timeout for Dashboards that are open for editing in Visual Composer. Dashboards open in the Portal are automatically closed after three minutes if the web browser is closed.
asset.sample.maxrows:: The row limit used for subqueries (inner select queries) performed before aggregation or joining. In some cases, subqueries that return too few results may not possess any rows that match the specified join condition. In these case, a higher subquery limit may be necessary to ensure that the final query returns results.
csv.import.max:: Sets the maximum size in bytes for CSV files imported into a Data Worksheet Embedded Table (see xref:dataworksheet:UploadData.adoc[]).
DistinctTableLens.maxrow:: Sets the maximum number of distinct values to display in a Condition '`Browse Data`' menu.
excel.sheet.maxrows:: Sets the integer row limit for every table within an Excel export. A message is displayed below each limited table to indicate that the data in the table has been truncated.
http.session.maxActive:: Maximum number of active sessions (default=10000). If a new session is created when the number of active sessions exceeds this property, the oldest session is invalidated.
http.session.maxPerClient:: Maximum number of sessions that a client (user/host) may have (default=5), not including `localhost`. If a new session is created when the number of active sessions exceeds this property, the oldest session for that client is invalidated.
http.session.maxWebsocketPerUser:: Maximum number of websocket connections that a single HTTP session may have (default=20). If a new connection is requested when the number of active connections exceeds this property, the connection fails and a SockJS downgrade will occur (XHR streaming, long polling, etc.).

http.session.timeout:: HTTP session timeout in seconds (default is 1800, which is 30 minutes). If no user activity is detected within this time period, the user will be shown a "session timeout" countdown allowing them the opportunity to keep the session alive if desired. (If the session timeout is set in the _web.xml_ file, that setting takes precedence over this property.)

join.table.maxrows:: Sets the maximum number of rows to retain in any Data Block that is created by joining two or more Data Blocks in a Data Worksheet. The limit does *not* apply to joins performed in the ‘Database Query’ dialog box (see xref:dataworksheet:QueryData.adoc[]). By default, the user will be shown only a single warning each session if the limit is violated. To warn the user for each individual violation, set `always.warn.joinMaxRows=true`.
olap.table.maxrow:: Determines how many rows to retrieve when creating unique values for selection lists. Default is 10000.
query.analysis.maxrow:: Number of rows that the Visualization Recommender should use when suggesting components to display data. Default=5000. (The Visualization Recommender is displayed when the user selects ‘Open Wizard’  in the ‘New Dashboard’ dialog box.)

query.preview.maxrow:: Sets the maximum number of rows retrieved for design-time requests. This includes  Data Worksheet ‘Live Data View’ and Dashboard design views in Visual Composer. See xref:TailorServerPerformance.adoc[] for more information.
query.preview.timeout:: Sets the timeout interval (seconds) for queries in Data Worksheet and Dashboard live data mode.
query.runtime.maxrow:: Sets the global maximum size for all queries during  Dashboard runtime execution. Data limits set at  Dashboard level are not permitted to exceed this global limit.
query.runtime.timeout:: Sets the global timeout (seconds) for all queries during Dashboard runtime execution.
rest.cache.timeout.millis:: Sets the timeout (milliseconds) for REST queries to be cached. Use a value greater than 0 to prevent repeated execution of similar REST queries. If a request is made before the cache entry expires, the cached response will be used instead of executing a new HTTP request. (Default is 0, no caching of REST queries.)
script.execution.timeout:: A safety-net for script execution time, especially for infinite loops. Times-out the script if execution time exceeds specified value (in seconds).
table.output.maxrow:: Sets the global maximum row limit for all Tables, Crosstabs, and Freehand Tables during Dashboard runtime execution. This property controls the size of the final displayed table, following any grouping and aggregation.

== Log Properties

font.afm.path:: Type 1 AFM file directories.
font.cmap.path:: Cmap file directories. Only used when processing CJK characters.
font.metrics.source:: TrueType to use TrueType fonts as specified in the directories in `font.truetype.path`.
font.preload:: `true` to pre-load the TrueType and Type 1 font information. This causes the server startup to be slower. If set to `false`, the loading is done the first time a PDF file is generated.
font.ratio.x:: A list of ratios used to adjust horizontal character spacing. This is mostly used when the font width information is different between Java and PDF. The ratio can be used to adjust the spacing so that the generated PDF matches the actual font size used in PDF viewers. It is a list of semi-colon separated ratios. Each ratio is specified by a font name and, optionally, a font style, followed by the ratio, e.g., `MS Hei:1.1;Algerian-bolditalic:1.02`.
font.ratio.y:: Similar to `font.ratio.x`, but is applied to the font vertical spacing.
font.truetype.path:: TrueType font directories.
html.encoding.utf8:: Default is `true`. If set to `false`, the HTML output is not encoded using UTF8. This may cause international characters to be displayed improperly.
pdf.compress.image:: `true` to compress all image data.

pdf.open.thumbnail:: `true` to have thumbnails immediately displayed when the generated PDF files are opened in Adobe Acrobat.
pdf.output.ascii:: `true` to generate only ASCII output in the PDF file. No ASCII data is encoded to seven bit data.
pdf.output.attachment:: Default is `true`. This sends generated PDF as an attachment. If set to `false`, the PDF is returned as-is. In IE 4 through 5, a URL referring to dynamically generated PDF could result in a blank page. Optionally, it can be set to `embed`, which will cause a PDF request to return a HTML page with an `<embed>` tag, which normally displays correctly in IE without causing a dialog to prompt users to save the PDF.
pdf.print.scaling:: `true` to make the PDF reader use the application default for the ‘Page Scaling’ print option. `false` to use ‘None’.
text.encoding.utf8:: Set to  `false` to use the encoding specified for the local operating system instead of the UTF8 encoding. Default is `true`.
viewsheet.font.size:: Specifies the default font size for all Dashboards. A plain integer value specifies an absolute size for all fonts. An integer preceded by a + or - indicates an increase or decrease in size from the default font sizes (e.g., `viewsheet.font.size=+5`).
vs.font.asDefault:: When set to `true`, uses the Dashboard default font for a Table rather than the Table Style font. When set to `false` (default), uses the specified Table Style font.

== Portal Properties

accessibility.enabled:: Set to `true` to enable features for Rehabilitation Act Section 508 compliance.

asset.ignore.filtering:: When `true` (default), this displays a warning message to the Dashboard designer when a Data Worksheet data block returns no data. The warning indicates that conditions on *all* data blocks will be dropped in Dashboard design view (only) to help facilitate formatting. When `false`, all conditions are kept in place (which may make Dashboard formatting more difficult).




flash.wmode:: Controls z-index assignment of HTML layers for Dashboards within IFrames. It can be assigned one of the following values: `window`, `opaque`, `transparent`. The `window` setting allows the browser to determine how the IFrame and Dashboard are displayed on the page. The `opaque` setting presents the IFrame and Dashboard with opaque background in their designated layer. The `transparent` setting presents the IFrame and Dashboard with transparent background in their designated layer.

help.url:: URL for the documentation. Default is http://www.inetsoft.com/docs/{productVersion}/userhelp.

hidden.datasource.types:: Comma-separated list of datasource names to be hidden in the User Portal datasource catalog. If a datasource is included in both the `visible.datasource.types` and `hidden.datasource.types` lists, it will be hidden. If the property is not specified or is empty, it will not be applied.

The following table lists a variety of security properties.  See xref:SpecifySecurityProvider.adoc[] and xref:TailorServerPerformance.adoc[] for related properties.

anonymous.userdata.save:: Set to `false` to prevent storage of preferences for the anonymous user.
enable.changePassword:: Set to `false` to disable users’ ability to change passwords in the User Portal (using the default security provider).
login.loginAs:: Set to `on` to permit an administrator to log in as a particular user. This adds a ‘Log in As’ action to the *Actions* tab of the *Security* page (see xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[]) that determines which users are allowed to access this function. If a user is granted permission for the ‘Log in As’ action, they will see a ‘Login as’ field on the Portal login screen,  and can log in as any user for which they are assigned “Administrator Permissions”.  See  xref:LoginAsDifferentUser.adoc[] for more information.
openid.property.provider:: Fully-qualified class name of an implementation of `inetsoft.web.security.sso.OpenIDPropertyProvider` that provides the OpenID Connect configuration for a given HTTP request.
openid.postprocessor:: Fully-qualified class name of an implementation of `inetsoft.web.security.sso.OpenIDPostprocessor` that modifies the SRPrincipal created by the SSO filter given the set of claims returned from the IdP.
role.administrator:: Only users with this role can log into the EM and administer the  server.
security.cache:: Caches data when using LDAP security for improved performance.
security.allow.iframe:: Set to `false` (default) to prevent the Enterprise Manager and User Portal login pages from being displayed within an IFrame. This is equivalent to setting the HTTP header property `X-Frame-Options` to `DENY`, and should be used in conjunction with Single Sign-On (SSO). See xref:integration:ConfigureSingleSignOn.adoc[] in xref:integration:AdvancedServerIntegration.adoc[]   for more information. Set to `true` when embedding the login pages within an IFrame. (The server must be using SSL in this case.)
sso.default.roles:: Sets the default roles for new user logging in via SSO.  Not applicable in a multi-tenant environment.  (See xref:EnableMultiTenant.adoc[] for more details on multi-tenancy.)
vpm.enforcement.policy:: Determines the scope of VPM enforcement: Set to `all` to generate an error if any query is not addressed by a VPM. Set to `user` to generate an error if any user query is not addressed by a VPM. (A “user query” is any query that is generated at runtime from a data model or a Data Worksheet) Set to `default` to permit the execution of queries that are not addressed by a VPM.
security.exposedefaultorgtoall:: When set to `true`, indicates that *all* organizations can see the Host Organization`'s Dashboards.  (The '`Host Organization`' is the default organization that is administered by the Site Administrator. See xref:CreateOrganization.adoc[] for more details.)  When set to `true` for a specific organization, e.g., `security.org0.exposedefaultorgtoall=true`, only the specific organization (`org0`) can see the Host Organization`'s Dashboards.


== Server Engine Properties
The following table lists a variety of server engine properties. Server engine properties include specifications relating to configuration file locations and names.

asset.backup.count:: Number of copies of the storage backup to retain. (Default=1.) See xref:Storage.adoc[] for more information.
assetData.thread.count:: The maximum number of Dashboards that can simultaneously execute queries  (for ‘cpu’ and ‘session’ keys only). Increase this value if a set of Dashboards with long-running queries is blocking the execution of other Dashboards. (Default is 12 times the CPU count.)
composer.comm.error:: Set to `true` (default) to warn user about server connection errors when using Dashboards. Set to `false` to suppress these warnings.
cpu.affinity.mask:: Controls which CPU cores the server process uses for execution. For example, `cpu.affinity.mask=0,2,4` restricts the server to use only CPU 0, CPU 2, and CPU 4.
html.session.timeout:: Inactivity timeout period for each  viewing session (in milliseconds). Default is 1200000 (20 minutes). When an open asset is inactive for the specified timeout period, the asset will be closed and the following message displayed: “Session timeout. Please re-open.”
html.image.directory:: Location to which images should be uploaded for  the  xref:viewsheet:ImageProperties.adoc#GeneralTab[Static Image] property of Image components. The  path should be specified relative to the root storage location.
javascript.java.packages:: List of JavaScript packages accessible to the scripting environment.
repository.asset.backup.enable:: Enables automatic backup of Data Worksheets and Dashboards. See xref:Storage.adoc[] to set this property in Enterprise Manager.
repository.asset.backup.time:: Sets the time for automatic backup of Data Worksheets and Dashboards. See xref:Storage.adoc[] to set this property in Enterprise Manager.
repository.user.timeout:: Inactivity timeout period for each user session (in milliseconds) for a server with session license. Default is 600000 (10 minutes). The user is logged out only when the session is inactive for the specified timeout period AND another concurrent user requires the session.
rmi.localhost.ip:: Set to `true` to use localhost rather than the specific IP address for connection to RMI servers (Scheduling and Monitoring). Default is `false`.
server.type:: Describes the server type: `rmi`, `servlet`, etc.
sree.bundle:: The name of the  localization bundle.


== Time and Date Properties
The following table lists a variety of time and date properties.

crosstab.dateTime.expandAll.level:: Sets the maximum expansion of date fields in a Crosstab. Options are `Year`, `QuarterOfYear`, `MonthOfYear` (default), `DayOfMonth`, `HourOfDay`, `MinuteOfHour`, `SecondOfMinute`.
mysql.local.timezone:: Set to a valid Java time zone ID to indicate the StyleBI server time zone (e.g., `US/Eastern`). If not defined, the default time zone is used.
week.start::   The start day of the week for date components such as  Calendars (e.g., `week.start=tuesday`). If not specified, the locale setting for the user determines the start day.
