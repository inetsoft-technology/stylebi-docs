Summary:
Security Actions (Action Permissions) in StyleBI governs access to various UI features and functionalities, such as portal tabs, worksheets, dashboards, and specialized actions like chart types, bookmarks, and SQL editing. Administrators can use these actions to restrict access and visibility based on user roles, ensuring proper security without detailing every individual action.

The procedure for setting object permissions (Actions) is the same for all components.  For example, to set permissions for the ‘Bookmark’ feature, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Security* page in the left panel.


. Select the *Actions* tab.

.Notes on Action Permissions
====
[square]
* For components under the ‘Data Source’ node, the ‘Use Parent Permissions’ setting implies that no permission is granted.

* Changing permission for a data source folder has the effect of changing permissions for all data sources contained in that folder.

* Permission for the ‘My Dashboards’ folder is granted by default for all users. However, if explicit permission for ‘My Dashboards’ is assigned to at least one user, then explicit permission must be assigned for any other users who require this feature.

* The ‘Use Parent Permissions’ setting is significant only for the asset components listed under the ‘Data Worksheet’ node. If you set permissions for the ‘Global’ node, they can be inherited by all of the assets under this node.
