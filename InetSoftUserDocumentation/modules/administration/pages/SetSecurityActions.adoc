.Notes on Action Permissions
====
[square]
* For components under the ‘Data Source’ node, the ‘Use Parent Permissions’ setting implies that no permission is granted.

* Changing permission for a data source folder has the effect of changing permissions for all data sources contained in that folder.

* Permission for the ‘My Dashboards’ folder is granted by default for all users. However, if explicit permission for ‘My Dashboards’ is assigned to at least one user, then explicit permission must be assigned for any other users who require this feature.

* The ‘Use Parent Permissions’ setting is significant only for the asset components listed under the ‘Data Worksheet’ node. If you set permissions for the ‘Global’ node, they can be inherited by all of the assets under this node.
