= Specify Security Provider

include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]


A security provider is a module that handles security operations for the InetSoft server. You can specify independent security providers to provide the following functions:

Authentication:: Retrieving users, roles, and groups; authenticating logins.
Authorization:: Storing and retrieving permissions for different components and functions.

To specify a security provider, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.
. Select the *Security* page in the left panel.
. Select ‘Enable Security’ to activate security settings.

. *_Optional_*: To allow users from multiple organizations to access the server, check '`Enable Multi-Tenancy`'.  See xref:EnableMultiTenant.adoc[] for more information.

. *_Optional_*: Check '`Enable Self Signup`' to enable the '`Create an Account`' option for users on the  login page.  See xref:EnableSelfSignup.adoc[].

. In the ‘Authentication’ menu, press the {buttonEdit} next to ‘Primary Provider’ or press ‘Add Provider’ and enter a provider name. Select the desired provider type for verifying user login credentials (‘Default’, ‘LDAP’, ‘Database’, or ‘Custom’).
. In the ‘Authorization’ menu, press the {buttonEdit} next to ‘Primary Provider’ or press ‘Add Provider’ and enter a provider name. Select the desired provider type for assigning asset and activity permissions (‘Default’ or ‘Custom’).
. *_Optional:_* Add any additional authentication or authorization providers by repeating the above steps. Press the {buttonDuplicateContent} for an existing provider to copy those settings to the new provider, if desired.

[NOTE]
.For Chaining Security Providers:
====
* For *authorization*, when the InetSoft server searches for an individual item (user, group, role, permission), it will reference the first provider that contains the item. When it searches for a list all items of a particular type, the set of items from all providers will be used.
* For *authentication*, the first provider that contains the given user will be used to authenticate. Note that if the authentication chain has first Provider 1 and then Provider 2, and both providers contain a given user _but with different credentials_, when the user tries to log in with Provider 2’s credentials, the login will fail. This is because Provider 1 is the first in the chain that contains the user (with different credentials).
* To create a *backup LDAP server*, simply chain together two providers. The first provider in the chain will be the primary LDAP server, and the second provider in the chain will be the backup.
* To facilitate recovery from a change in LDAP or database administrator credential, create a secondary file-based (default) provider that contains a fallback administrative user.

The available provider types are as follows:

Default (File):: This is the built-in security provider, and can be used for both authentication and authorization.

* When using the ‘Default Security Provider’, the default login/password to the Enterprise Manager is admin/admin.
* When you select the default security provider for *authentication*,  create users, groups, and roles as explained in xref:administration:CreateUser.adoc[], xref:CreateRole.adoc[], and xref:CreateGroup.adoc[]. When you select the default security provider for *authorization*,  assign permissions for components, capabilities, and assets as explained in xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] and xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[].

LDAP:: This specifies a third-party LDAP server (e.g., Active Directory) that contains your users/groups/roles, and can be used for *authentication* only. For more information, see xref:ConfigureLDAPSecurity.adoc[].

* Assign permissions for components, capabilities, and assets as explained in xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] and xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[].
* Create users, groups, and roles using the LDAP platform.
Database::
This specifies queries to retrieve user/role/group information a database schema, and can be used for *authentication* only. For more information, see xref:ConfigureDatabaseSecurity.adoc[].

Custom:: This specifies a Java class that implements the ‘Security Provider’ interface, and can be used for both authentication and authorization.

Enter the custom configuration in the ‘JSON Configuration’ panel. Security classes have the following methods that you can overwrite to suit your needs:
