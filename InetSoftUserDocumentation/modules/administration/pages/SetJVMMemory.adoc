= Set Docker Container Memory
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

During *initial creation* of the Docker container only, use `-Xmx` and `-Xms` in the `JAVA_MEMORY_OPTS` environment variable in `docker-compose.yaml` to adjust the memory available to the Docker container.

.Example:
[source,yaml]
JAVA_MEMORY_OPTS: "-Xms6g -Xmx6g"


On *Linux*, Docker is constrained by the host machine's memory.  On *Windows*, using Docker Desktop with WSL,  memory is constrained by the memory allocated for WSL in the `` %USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`` file. For example, the following setting limits the machine to 6GB of memory, which  cannot be exceeded by any Docker container:

.Example:
[source]
----
[wsl2]
memory=6GB
----

To change the Docker container memory at a later time, stop the existing container and start a new container with the desired memory setting.
