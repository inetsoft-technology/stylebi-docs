The audit feature tracks Dashboard and data access, as well as asset dependencies. When auditing is enabled, all Dashboard and database access is logged in the audit database. Note that auditing requires you to  enable a security provider (see xref:SpecifySecurityProvider.adoc[]).

[#ConfiguretheAuditDatabase]
== Configure the Audit Database

You can configure the Audit database in the *docker-compose.yaml* file. This may be useful if you want to generate custom audit dashboards from the audit data. You can connect to the custom JDBC URL as you would connect to any other JDBC data source. (See xref:user:JDBC.adoc[] in xref:user:UsePortal.adoc[].)

NOTE: It is not possible to create custom audit dashboards from the default Audit database. You can only access the default database through the xref:#AvailableReports[] above.


The following listing shows sample variables that should be added to _docker-compose.yaml_  before container creation to use the custom database for audit records.
