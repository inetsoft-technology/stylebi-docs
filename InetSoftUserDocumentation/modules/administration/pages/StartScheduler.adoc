The Scheduler can also be used as a standalone application through the https://www.inetsoft.com/docs/2018/apidoc/index.html?overview-summary.html[ScheduleServer] class. It has a main method so that it can be run as a process:

 java -Dsree.home=. inetsoft.sree.schedule.ScheduleServer

If the classpath is not already set (e.g., by an environment variable), the classpath should also be specified, as follows:

 java -cp {CLASSPATH}  -Dsree.home=. inetsoft.sree.schedule.ScheduleServer

You can find an example `pass:[{CLASSPATH}]` in the ‘Scheduler Classpath’ field in Enterprise Manager to use as a guide.

The launching application can then get an instance of the Scheduler object:

[source,java]
Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler.getScheduler();
