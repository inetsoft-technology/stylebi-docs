To start or stop the Scheduler application, or to view its operational status, follow the steps below:




[TIP]
====
To invoke a custom listener class at the start and end of each scheduled task, specify the fully-qualified name of the class as the value of the `schedule.task.listener` property. See xref:AllProperties.adoc[] for more information about setting properties.

== Start from Docker
In a typical environment, you can start the Scheduler by starting the Scheduler Docker container.

The Scheduler can also be used as a standalone application through the https://www.inetsoft.com/docs/stylebi/apidoc/inetsoft/sree/schedule/ScheduleServer.html[ScheduleServer] class. It has a main method so that it can be run as a process:

 java -Dsree.home=. inetsoft.sree.schedule.ScheduleServer

If the classpath is not already set (e.g., by an environment variable), the classpath should also be specified, as follows:

 java -cp {CLASSPATH}  -Dsree.home=. inetsoft.sree.schedule.ScheduleServer

You can find an example `pass:[{CLASSPATH}]` in the ‘Scheduler Classpath’ field in Enterprise Manager to use as a guide.

The launching application can then get an instance of the Scheduler object:

[source,java]
Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler.getScheduler();


== Check Scheduler Status
To  check the Scheduler status, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.
