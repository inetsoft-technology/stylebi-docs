The configuration directory (_var/lib/inetsoft/config_)  contains all the configuration files, including the following:

inetsoft.yaml:: Top-level configuration file for back-end storage. This file also contains the audit database configuration, the Hazelcast cluster configuration, as well as other top-level initialization settings. See xref:Storage.adoc[] for more information about configuring back-end storage.  See xref:Audit.adoc#ConfiguretheAuditDatabase[Configure the Audit Database] for information about adjusting database settings.

sree.log:: Contains log events (plain text) for the InetSoft server.

schedule.log:: Contains log events (plain text) for the Scheduler application.

CAUTION: Hand-editing configuration files is *not  recommended* unless such editing is specifically prescribed in the documentation. (For example, xref:Storage.adoc[] describes adding properties to _inetsoft.yaml_.)
