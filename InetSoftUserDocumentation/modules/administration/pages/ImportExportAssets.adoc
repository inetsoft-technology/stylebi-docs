NOTE:   To automate deployment of assets, see xref:ManageContent.adoc[]. To manage the storage database, see xref:Storage.adoc[].

An *asset* is any Dashboard or component (Table Style,  Data Worksheet, etc.). To move assets from one server environment to another server environment (e.g., from a test server to a production server), use the incremental deployment features described in the following sections.


[#ExportAssets]
== Export Assets

To export a set of assets from the server into an archive (ZIP) file, follow the steps below:

The ‘Required Assets Included’ table at the bottom of the dialog box updates shows the assets used by the entries in the ‘Selected Assets’ panel.

. Mark the appropriate check-boxes  to include the corresponding assets in the export file.

. Check ‘Overwrite assets of same name’ if the assets in the archive should by default overwrite existing assets of the same name when imported into the new environment. This behavior can be modified if needed when the assets are imported.

. Press btn:[Export] to save the ZIP file. Depending on your browser’s configuration, you will either be prompted to save the archive file in the browser’s designated download directory, or you will be prompted to choose a location in which to save the export file.

See xref:#ImportAssets[]  for instructions on how to import the assets from the ZIP file into another server environment.

[#ImportAssets]
== Import Assets

To import a set of assets from an archive file generated by the ‘Export Asset’ feature (see xref:#ExportAssets[]), follow the steps below:

IMPORTANT: You cannot import a *user-scope* asset into an environment which has security disabled, or which has no definition for the particular user.

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Content* page in the left panel, and select the *Repository* tab.

The items listed in the ‘Selected Entities’ panel will all be imported. The items listed in the ‘Required Assets Included’ table are required by items in the ‘Selected Entities’ panel, and will be imported by default. However, if one or more of these items already exist in the current server environment, you can choose not to import those items.

. Select the assets in the ‘Required Assets Included’ table that you wish to import.

. Select ‘Overwrite assets of same name’ if the assets in the archive should overwrite existing assets of the same name upon import. The default setting of the ‘Overwrite existing files’ checkbox is specified by the export settings under which the archive was saved. (See xref:#ExportAssets[].)

. *_Optional:_* Select ‘Target Location’ if you wish to import the assets to a repository folder *other than* the assets’ original repository location.

. *_Optional:_* Enable ‘Apply Target to Dependencies’ to import asset dependencies into the specified ‘Target Location’. Otherwise, they are copied into their  original repository locations.

. Press btn:[Finish] to import these assets into the current environment.
