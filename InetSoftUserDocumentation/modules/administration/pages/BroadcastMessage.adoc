IMPORTANT: The broadcast feature requires that a security provider be specified.  See xref:ConfigureSecurity.adoc[].  In a multi-tenant environment, only the Site Administrator can access the Broadcast feature.  (See xref:EnableMultiTenant.adoc[] for more information about multi-tenancy.)

To send an alert to all currently logged-in users, press the {buttonSendNotification} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

This opens the ‘Broadcast’ dialog box, where you can enter a message to be relayed to users.

When you have entered the desired message, press btn:[Send]. The message will be displayed to active users within about one minute after sending. You can use this mechanism to warn of system-wide scheduled maintenance, for example.
