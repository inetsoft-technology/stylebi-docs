The default login/password is `admin/admin`. For security reasons, login information expires after five minutes. If you receive a ‘Login Expired’ warning, simply re-enter your credentials to log in.



Before you begin managing resources and configuring components in Enterprise Manager, verify that you have completed the following steps:

* Specify valid license keys. See xref:AdministerLicenseKeys.adoc[].
* Ensure that the minimum system requirements are satisfied: {minimumReq}
* Allocate the desired amount of memory to the Docker container. See xref:SetJVMMemory.adoc[] for more information.
