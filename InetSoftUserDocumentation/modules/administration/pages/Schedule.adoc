= Schedule


The Scheduler is an application that automatically generates  Dashboards on an assigned schedule. The Scheduler is available to both administrators and  users (with appropriate permissions).

NOTE: The Scheduler is a stand-alone application. It runs independently of the  application server  as a separate process. Therefore, even if the  server becomes unresponsive, the Scheduler continues to run.

The topics in this section explain how to use the Scheduler.
