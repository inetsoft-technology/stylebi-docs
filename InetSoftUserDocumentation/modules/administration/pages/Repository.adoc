include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

The *Repository* is the collection of   Dashboards deployed on the server.   Dashboards can be organized into folders, and folders can be hierarchically nested. If  security is enabled, users and roles can be given read and write permission for  folders or individual  Dashboards.

TIP: To refresh the repository listing, reload the page in the browser.

To manage  the repository, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Content* page in the left panel, and select the *Repository* tab.
+

. Perform the desired operations described in the following sections.


== Sort the Repository

Assets in the ‘Repository’ tree (both in Enterprise Manager and User Portal) are listed in alphabetical order according to the Dashboard name specified in the ‘Name’ field. To reverse the listing, use the ‘Sort Repository Tree’ option on the *Look and Feel* page. (See xref:Presentation.adoc[].) To display assets in an arbitrary order, use the  ‘Name’ to control the ordering, and use the  ‘Alias’ to specify the displayed names.

.Controlling Sorting with Name and Alias
[example]
====
|===
|Name|Alias

|dashboard1|First Dashboard
|dashboard2|Middle Dashboard
|dashboard3|Last Dashboard
|===
This forces the Dashboards to appear in the desired logical order (First Dashboard, Middle Dashboard, Last Dashboard), which is different from the alphabetical order.

== Create a Repository Folder

To create a new folder, follow the steps below:

. Select a parent folder for the new folder in the Repository tree. The parent folder can be the root ‘Repository’ node or any other folder. (You can change the parent folder later, if needed.)

. Press the   {buttonNewCircle} above the Repository tree and select ‘New Folder’.
+
image:RepositoryNewFolder.png[]

+
This opens the folder definition page, which has two tabs: *Property* and *Security*.

. Under the *Property* tab, specify the new ‘Folder Name’ and optional  ‘Description’.
+
image:Figure 18.png[]

. *_Optional:_* Set the folder ‘Alias’. The alias is displayed to the user in the Portal in place of the folder’s actual name. If no alias is specified, the folder’s name is used.

. Set the folder’s permissions using the *Security* tab. By default, a folder is set to inherit security permissions from its *parent*, which is the containing folder. You can override the default behavior and give a  folder  its own security configuration. Follow the steps below:

.. To set independent permissions for the folder, uncheck ‘Derive Permissions from Parent’.
+
.Expand to view a list of parent permissions

. Press btn:[Apply].

To move an asset such as a  Dashboard into the folder, simply drag the asset into the folder in the Repository tree.


== Delete an Asset

IMPORTANT: *End users* can also delete an asset  if they have ‘delete’ permission on the asset. (See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[].)

To delete a  Dashboard or folder from the repository tree, follow the steps below:

. Click to select the desired asset in the tree.

. Press the {buttonDelete} above the tree.
+
[square]
* If the deleted asset was in the global  repository, the asset is moved to the Recycle Bin.

* If the asset was in a user folder (under ‘User Private Assets’, which corresponds to the user`'s “My Dashboards” folder), the asset is *permanently deleted*.
+
TIP: When a folder is deleted, all  subfolders and their contents will be deleted as well.


. To permanently remove an asset or folder from the Recycle Bin, select the asset or folder in the Recycle Bin and press the {buttonDelete} above the tree.

[#RestoreDeletedAsset]
== Restore a Deleted Asset
To restore a folder or asset (including auto-saved asset) from the Recycle Bin, follow the steps below.

NOTE: Deleted user-scope assets cannot be recovered.

. Select the ‘Recycle Bin’ node on the Repository tree, and choose ‘Repository’  or ‘Auto Saved Files’.

. Select the asset or folder that you want to restore and press btn:[Restore].
+

To export an asset from the Recycle Bin, see xref:ImportExportAssets.adoc[].



== Configure a Dashboard

To add a Dashboard to the Repository, use Visual Composer to save the Dashboard into a global scope (see xref:viewsheet:SavePublicDashboard.adoc[]) or import the Dashboard (see xref:ImportExportAssets.adoc[]).To modify properties of a Dashboard, follow the steps below:


. Click to select the desired Dashboard in the tree.

. To set the basic properties of the Dashboard, select the *Dashboard* tab. Set the desired options:
+
image:Viewsheet Definition Page.png[]
+
Name:: The name under which the Dashboard should be listed in the Repository. Certain characters (e.g., “/”) are not permitted in names.
Alias:: The Dashboard name displayed to the user in the Portal.
Description:: A brief description to be displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over the Dashboard in the Portal or Visual Composer Repository trees.

. To set the basic permissions for the Dashboard, select the *Security* tab. By default, a Dashboard is set to inherit security permissions from its *parent*, which is the containing folder. You can override this default behavior and give  a Dashboard  its own security configuration. Follow the steps below:

.. To set independent permissions for the Dashboard, uncheck ‘Derive Permissions from Parent’.

.. Press the btn:[Add] button to assign permissions to users, roles, or groups. See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] for more information.

. To create a materialized view (high-performace cache), select the *MV* tab. See xref:MaterializedView.adoc[] for more information.
+
image:Viewsheet MV Page.png[]
+
IMPORTANT: For multi-tenant implementations utilizing the *additional connection* feature (see xref:user:AddAdditionalConnection.adoc[]), materialized views are created based on user/group connection assignments.  For this reason, if you set a Dashboard’s permissions by *role*, you must also add individual permissions for users or groups that have particular connections. This will enable the materialized views to be generated from the appropriate connections.

. Press btn:[Apply].


[#PortalDashboards]
== Pin a Dashboard

TIP: Users can also deploy Dashboards under the {buttonDashboard}.  See xref:user:DeployDashboard.adoc[] for more information.

A Portal Dashboard or "`pinned Dashboard`" is a Dashboard that appear under the {buttonDashboard} in the User Portal. To pin a Portal Dashboard, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Content* page in the left panel, and select the *Repository* tab.
+
image:Figure 15.png[]

. Select the ‘Portal Dashboard Tab’ folder on the tree. Press the {buttonNewCircle} above the tree, and select ‘New Dashboard’.
+
image:newDashboard.png[]

. Select the *Property* tab in the right panel. In the ‘Name’ field, enter a name for the new Dashboard. This name will be displayed on this Dashboard’s tab in the User Portal.

. *_Optional:_*  Enter a description for the Dashboard in the ‘Description’ field. This description is visible when the Dashboard is being edited by administrator or user.
+
image:Dashboard Properties Dialog VS_1.png[]

. Choose a Dashboard from the ‘Select Dashboard’ list.
+
image:Edit Dashboard Admin VS.png[]

. Select the *Security* tab in the right panel. See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] for information on how to assign permissions.

. Press btn:[Apply].

The new Dashboard is now listed in the ‘Portal Dashboard Tab’ folder, and will be visible to the users who have appropriate permissions. To delete a Dashboard, select the Dashboard and press the {buttonDelete} above the repository list.

== Manage Data Worksheets
To add a Data Worksheet to the Repository, use Visual Composer to save the Data Worksheet into a global scope (see xref:dataworksheet:EditDataWorksheet.adoc[]) or import the Data Worksheet (see xref:ImportExportAssets.adoc[]).

To set Data Worksheet properties such as name, description, materialized view, and security, and follow the steps below:


. Expand the ‘Data Worksheets’ node on the content tree, and select the desired Data Worksheet.
+
image:Materialized View Worksheet1.png[]

. Select the *Data Worksheet* tab on the right to set the name, alias, and description.
+
Name:: The name under which the Data Worksheet should be listed in the Portal. Certain characters (e.g., “/”) are not permitted in name.
Alias:: The Data Worksheet name displayed to the user in the Portal.
Description:: A brief description to be displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse over the Data Worksheet in the Portal or Visual Composer Repository trees.


. Select the *Security* tab to manage Data Worksheet permissions. See xref:SetRepositoryPermissions.adoc[] for more information about assigning permissions.
