[#CreateScheduledTask]
== Create a Scheduled Task

A *scheduled task* is an action or set of actions that occur automatically on a schedule, such as emailing a Dashboard to certain users every morning. To create a scheduled task, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.
. Select the *Schedule* page in the left panel, and select the *Tasks* tab at the top.
+

include::partial$selectOrganization.adoc[]

. Press the btn:[New Task] button under the table. This creates a new task, with the default name ‘Task n’ (e.g., Task1, Task2, Task3, etc.).
. Select the *Conditions* tab and specify a condition to determine when the task will execute. See xref:SchedulerConditions.adoc[] for details.
+
TIP: To run a task *on demand*, see xref:#MonitorScheduledTasks[] below.

. Select the *Actions* tab and specify the type of action to take when the scheduled task executes. See xref:SchedulerActions.adoc[] for details.
. *_Optional:_* Select the *Options* tab to set advanced properties.
+
[#SchedulerOptions]
.Scheduler Options
****
Enabled:: A task can be temporarily enabled or disabled by selecting or deselecting this option.
Delete if not scheduled to run again:: If a task is scheduled to run once, this option will delete it from the system once it runs.
Start From and Stop On:: A task will only execute within the specified date range.
Execute As:: A task can be executed as a user, in which case user permissions will influence the execution of the task. For example, if VPMs (data-level security) are set up, different users will see different data. All the existing users who have permission to use the scheduler will be included in the drop-down list.
Locale:: A different locale can be specified for each individual task by using this option.
****
. Press the btn:[Save] button at the bottom to save the task.

A *scheduled cycle* is a time condition that can be used to automate materialized view generation (see xref:MaterializedView.adoc[]).  It is the "`Conditions`" part of a scheduled task alone, without the "`Actions`" part.

To create a new cycle, follow the steps below.

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Schedule* page in the left panel, and select the *Data Cycles* tab at the top.
+

include::partial$selectOrganization.adoc[]

. Press the btn:[New Cycle] button to create a new cycle.
+
image:newCycleLink.png[]

. In the ‘Name’ field enter a name for the cycle, and set the cycle time condition. See xref:SchedulerConditions.adoc[] for details on the different time conditions available.
+

. Select the *Options* tab, and set the desired options:
[square]
* ‘Notification of Cycle Start’ emails the specified addresses when the cycle begins.
* ‘Notification of Cycle Completion’ emails the specified addresses when the cycle concludes.
* ‘Notification of Cycle Failure’ emails the specified addresses if the cycle terminates abnormally.
* ‘Notification of Cycle Threshold Exceeded’ emails the specified addresses if the cycle runs for longer than the specified number of seconds.

. Select the *Security* tab, and assign the desired permissions for the cycle. See xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[] for instructions on how to assign permissions.

. Press the btn:[Save] button at the bottom of the panel.

. *_Optional:_* To create additional conditions on the cycle, press the btn:[Add] button.

+

. Create the new condition as described above.

. To edit one of multiple conditions, select the desired condition in the list.

. To delete one of multiple conditions, select the desired condition, and press btn:[Delete].


To delete a cycle, select the cycle you want to delete in the table, and press the btn:[Delete] button below the table.

[#CreateAlert]
== Create an Alert

[WARNING,caption= SEE ALSO]
xref:#CreateAutomatedAlert[], below,  to run or suppress the delivery options based on your own custom Dashboard logic.


An *alert* is a notification that a specified event has occurred, for example, that total sales have fallen below some critical level. You can set an alert based on highlight conditions in a Dashboard, or based on Dashboard Output component ranges.

To configure an alert for a  Dashboard, follow the steps below:

. Create a new scheduled task. See xref:#CreateScheduledTask[] above for instructions.

. On the *Conditions* tab, set the frequency with which the alert conditions should be tested. (See xref:SchedulerConditions.adoc[] for more details on the available day and time conditions.) For example, if you want to test a  highlight condition every day, specify a ‘Daily’ condition.

. On the *Actions* tab, specify the  Dashboard that contains the alert condition you want to test.
+
image:Alert2_1.png[]

. Select the actions that you want to perform if the alert is triggered. Generally, you will at least select the ‘Deliver To Emails’ option. (See xref:SchedulerActions.adoc[] for more about the available actions.) Enter a ‘Subject’ and ‘Message’ appropriate for the nature of the alert.


. In the ‘Alert’ panel at the bottom of the *Actions* tab, check the ‘Execute action only under selected highlight conditions’ option. The table lists highlight conditions for all chart, table, image, and text components, as well as range conditions for Dashboard Output components.
+
TIP: This panel is only available if the  Dashboard contains highlights or ranges.

. In the table, select the highlight or range conditions that you want to trigger the alert. When *any* of the selected conditions test true, the actions you specified above (e.g., emailing) will be performed.

. Press btn:[Save] to save the scheduled task.

See xref:user:ScheduleDashboard.adoc[] in xref:user:UseDashboard.adoc[] for information on how an end-user can set an alert. See xref:#CreateAutomatedAlert[] below for information about setting an alert based on conditions that are *not* defined in a highlight.

[#CreateAutomatedAlert]
== Create an Automated Alert
[WARNING,caption=see also]
xref:#CreateAlert[], above, to easily create an  alert based on existing highlight conditions in a  Dashboard.

You can  implement an *automated alert* based on arbitrary conditions by creating a scheduled task that executes when specified conditions are met by the Dashboard data. This allows you to automatically inform a user when results within the data demand their attention (e.g., inventory falls below a certain level, order volume spikes, etc.).

To create an automated alert, follow the steps below:

. Create the scheduled task as described in xref:#CreateScheduledTask[] above. Make the following settings:

.. In the ‘Dashboard’ menu of the *Actions* tab, choose the  Dashboard which contains the data you wish to evaluate.
.. Configure the task actions (notification, email, etc.) to accomplish the desired “alert” behavior. For example, if you wish to generate an email to users when a Dashboard data indicator meets certain criteria, configure the ‘Deliver to Emails’ message to convey the desired alert.
.. Configure the settings on the *Conditions* tab to execute the task at the interval at which you wish to evaluate the  Dashboard data.

. Within the specified  Dashboard, implement the logic which determines whether an alert should be dispatched. In general, you should place the script containing this logic on the individual component containing the data to be evaluated.
+
TIP: See xref:viewsheetscript:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc[] for more information on where to add script.
+
Within this  script, place a call to    `scheduleAction()` to specify whether the scheduled task should execute or not (based on the logic you implemented above).   If a  script sets `thisViewsheet.scheduleAction(false)`, the scheduled task will not execute.

. Deploy the  Dashboard to the repository as you usually would.

When this scheduled task executes (as determined by the  settings on the *Conditions* tab), the Scheduler will check to see whether `scheduleAction()` is set to `true` or `false` for the  Dashboard. If the value is `false`, the Scheduler aborts the task actions, and no alerts are issued. If the value is `true`, the Scheduler proceeds to execute the task actions, and any specified alerts are delivered to users.


== Organize Scheduled Tasks

[#MonitorScheduledTasks]
== Monitor Scheduled Tasks
To monitor scheduled tasks, first open the menu:Schedule[Tasks] page.  (See xref:#CreateScheduledTask[] above.)  The table under the *Tasks* tab displays basic information (such as start time, end time, status of the last run, etc.) for all scheduled tasks.
