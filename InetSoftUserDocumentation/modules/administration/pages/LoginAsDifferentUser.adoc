NOTE: This method does *not* require knowledge of the user’s password.

To login as a particular user, follow the steps below:

. On the *All Properties* page (see xref:AllProperties.adoc[]), add the following property:
+
 login.loginAs=on
+
This adds a ‘Log in As’ action to the *Actions* tab of the *Security* page that determines which users are allowed to login as another user.

. Select the ‘Log in As’ action on the *Actions* tab of the *Security* page.  (See xref:SetSecurityActions.adoc[].) Assign permission to the users, groups, or roles who should have access to this feature.

. Specify which users can have their login emulated by the selected user:

* To allow the selected user (for example, a site administrator) to login as *any user in the system*, ensure that the user has “Administrator Permissions” for all other users (or belongs to a role that has “Administrator Permissions” for all other users). See xref:CreateUser.adoc[] and xref:CreateGroup.adoc[] for more information about setting “Administrator Permissions”.

* To allow the selected user (for example, a tenant administrator) to login as *any user in the tenant organization*, add all users of the tenant organization to a unique group, and ensure that the selected user has “Administrator Permission” for that group (or belongs to a role that has “Administrator Permission” for that group). See xref:CreateGroup.adoc[] for more information about setting “Administrator Permissions”.

. Open the User Portal.

. On the login screen, enter your *administrator* name and password. The login screen displays a special ‘Login as’ field.

. In the ‘Login as’ field, enter the name of the user whose environment you wish to access.

. Press the btn:[Sign in] button.

This will effectively log you in as the user without requiring the user’s password. Operations that you perform while logged in using this method (i.e., as administrator emulating a user) are listed in audit records as administrator operations, rather than as user operations.
