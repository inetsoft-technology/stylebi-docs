Enterprise Manager provides the ability to log messages generated during server and Scheduler execution. Logged messages are appended to a text file (default are *sree.log* for the server and *schedule.log* for the Scheduler, both in _/var/lib/inetsoft/config_) and optionally written to the standard output stream. For information on viewing log files, see xref:MonitorServerActivity.adoc[].


To configure logging settings, follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonSettings} at the top of Enterprise Manager.

. Select the *Logging* page in the left panel.

The following properties are available:

Log Type:: Allows you to select between '`Default File`' and '`Fluent Bit/Fluentd`'.
+
include::ROOT:partial$enterpriseOnly.adoc[]


Output to Standard Output:: When enabled, sends log messages to the standard output stream.

Log File:: The location and base name of the log file.

Maximum Log File Size:: The maximum size (KB) to which the log file should be allowed to grow before it is rotated. To rotate the log file manually, see xref:MonitorServerActivity.adoc[].

Number of Backup Log Files:: Specifies the number of rotated log files to maintain (e.g., *sree-IP-1.log*, *sree-IP-2.log*, etc.). Backup log files are created when the size of the log exceeds the ‘Maximum Log File Size’ property or the log is rotated manually.

Default Log Detail Level:: There are four available detail levels. It is recommended that you set the  level to ‘Warning’ or ‘Info’ for routine use.

* *Debug* provides internal execution-tracing information for debugging purposes. This will allow you to record  user-entered parameters, query details, materialized view usage, as well as much other information. This logging level can produce very verbose output, which may be needed when diagnosing a problem in collaboration with InetSoft Technical Support.
* *Info* reports information about the state of the server, such as the security provider in use, as well as warnings and errors.
* *Warning* reports issues that do not prevent normal operation, but indicate a possible problem that should be investigated.
* *Error* reports issues that prevent normal operation.

You can assign custom log levels to particular assets. For example, you can set a ‘Warning’ log level for the ‘Default Log Detail Level’ property, but still set a ‘Debug’ log level for a particular Dashboard. To set a custom log level, follow the steps below:

. Press the btn:[Add] button below the table. This adds a new log level.

. In the ‘Context’ menu, select the type of asset (e.g.,  Dashboard, query, etc.) to which you want to assign a distinct log level.

. In the ‘Name’ field, enter the name of the asset for which you want to set a custom log level.

. Select the desired logging level for this particular asset. (See above for level information.)

. Press btn:[OK], and then press btn:[Apply].

To remove a custom log level, select the custom log level in the table and press the btn:[Remove] button below the table.
