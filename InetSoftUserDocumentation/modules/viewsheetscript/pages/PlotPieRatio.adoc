include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]


A value in the range [0.1,1] that determines the proportion of the plot area occupied by the *pie element* of the xref:viewsheet:PieChart.adoc[]. Similarly-sized Pie charts with the same ratio setting will display pies having the same radius, which can be used to enforce consistency across multiple charts.

CAUTION: Large  ratio settings may leave less area for the display of values on the Chart and cause truncation of text.

== Type
Number between 0.1 and 1



== Example
[source,javascript]
Chart1.pieRatio = 0.8;
Chart2.pieRatio = 0.5;
