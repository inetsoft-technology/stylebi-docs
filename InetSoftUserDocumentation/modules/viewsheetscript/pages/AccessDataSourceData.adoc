= Access Datasource Data

You can access data contained in the Dashboard data source from within any Dashboard script. The following sections explain the syntax for accessing data from the data source data. See xref:AccessComponentData.adoc[] for information on how to access the specific data represented in a component.

[#ReferenceDatasourceData]
== Reference Datasource Data
You can access data from the Dashboard’s data source from within any script. To do this, click the desired data field under the ‘Data’ folder in the Editor to insert the field into the script.

Note that *Date*-type fields supply the following date parts: Year, QuarterOfYear, MonthOfYear, DayOfMonth, and DayOfWeek. *Time*-type fields supply the following date parts: HourOfDay, MinuteOfHour, SecondOfMinute. *TimeInstant*-type fields supply all of the previous date parts.

For example, to access a value in a Data Worksheet data block called ‘TopSales’, select the field from the ‘Data’ folder as described above, or manually type the desired reference. Some examples are shown below:

NOTE: In general, data block operations should be performed in the Data Worksheet rather than the Dashboard.

.Example: Access Data Worksheet data blocks
[source,javascript]
----
// Array of all values in ‘Price’ field from ‘TopSales’:
TopSales['Price']

// Third row, fifth column from ‘TopSales’:
TopSales[2][4]

// Third row of the ‘Price’ field in from ‘TopSales’:
TopSales[2]['Price']
----
If the data source name contains a space (e.g., ‘Top Sales’), use the `viewsheet` keyword to form the reference, as shown below:

.Example: Space in name
[source,javascript]
viewsheet['Top Sales']['Price']

You can access data from a *data model*  in the same manner. For example, to access data from the ‘Product Name’ attribute of the ‘Order Model’ data model, use the following syntax. (Use the `viewsheet` keyword because the name contains a space):

.Example: Data model attribute
[source,javascript]
viewsheet['Order Model']['Product:Name']




To perform aggregations on referenced data from within the script, see xref:#AggregateData[].

.Extract data from data block
[example]
====
Consider a Dashboard that uses the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet as its data source, and you want a single Text component to display the range of dates contained in the ‘Date’ field of the ‘Sales’ data block. You can do this by referencing the desired dates directly from the ‘Sales’ data block in an *onInit* script, as shown below. (See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddDashboardScript[Add Dashboard Script] for more information about the onInit handler.) Data from the ‘Date’ field of the ‘Sales’ data block is available in array `Sales['Date']`.

include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]

[source,javascript]
----
// Latest value in ‘Date’ field from ‘Sales’ data block:
var lastDate = Last(Sales['Date'], Sales['Date']);
// Earliest value in ‘Date’ field from ‘Sales’ data block:
var firstDate= First(Sales['Date'], Sales['Date']);
----

You can then add a script to a Text component to display the date range in the desired manner. (See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddComponentScript[Add Component Script] for more information about scripting a component.)

[source,javascript]
Text1.text = 'Data from ' + formatDate(firstDate,'MMM d, yyyy') + ' to ' + formatDate(lastDate,'MMM d, yyyy') ;

To aggregate data from the data source within Dashboard script, use the following syntax:

[source,javascript]
aggregationMethod(data_reference)

NOTE: In general, data block operations should be performed in the Data Worksheet rather than the Dashboard.

See xref:#ReferenceDatasourceData[] for the syntax of the data reference. For example, to obtain the sum or average of the column ‘Price’ from data block ‘TopSales’, use an expression such as the following:

[source,javascript]
var sumPrice = Sum(TopSales['Price'])
var avePrice = Average(TopSales['Price'])

To reference a data source that has a space in the name (e.g., “Top Sales”), use the `viewsheet` keyword as follows:

.Example: Space in name
[source,javascript]
var avePrice = Average(viewsheet['Top Sales']['Price'])

The following aggregation methods are available. These functions are not case-sensitive (e.g., “Sum” and “sum” are both valid.) Note that you can use other functions from the Function Library as well, for example xref:commonscript:CalcObjectFunctions.adoc[].

[cols="1,1,2"]

.Aggregate data in data block
[example]
====
Consider a Dashboard that uses the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet as its data source, and you want a single Text component to display the range of values contained in the ‘Total’ field of the ‘Sales’ data block. You can do this by referencing the desired dates directly from the ‘Sales’ data block in an onInit script, as shown below. (See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddDashboardScript[Add Dashboard Script] for more information about the onInit handler.)

include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]


Data from the ‘Total’ field of the ‘Sales’ data block is available in array `Sales['Total']`.

[source,javascript]
----
// Largest value in ‘Total’ field from ‘Sales’ data block:
var maxT = Max(Sales['Total']);
// Smallest value in ‘Total’ field from ‘Sales’ data block:
var minT= Min(Sales['Total']);
----
You can then add a script to a Text component to display the number range in the desired manner. (See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddComponentScript[Add Component Script] for more information about scripting a component.)

[source,javascript]
Text1.text = 'Totals range from  ' + formatNumber(minT,'$#,###.00') + ' to ' + formatNumber(maxT,'$#,###.00');
