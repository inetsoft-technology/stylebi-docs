Returns the name of the field *one level below* the deepest level in the hierarchy at which the user has made a selection in a *Selection Tree*. This is useful for creating interactive chart drilldowns, as shown in the example in xref:viewsheetscript:AccessComponentData.adoc#FilterComponents[Filter Components].

NOTE: `drillMember` does not apply to Selection Lists.


For example, consider a three-level Selection Tree hierarchy: menu:Region[State > City].

If the user’s most specific selection is at the level of region, then drillMember returns `'State'`. If the user’s most specific selection is at the level of state, then drillMember returns `'City'`. If the user’s most specific selection is at the level of city, then because there is no lower level drillMember again returns `'City'`. If the user has not selected any values in the Selection Tree, then `drillMember` returns the highest level, here `'Region'`.


== Type
String::			field name for child of deepest selected level










== Example
[source,javascript]
var drillField = SelectionTree1.drillMember;
