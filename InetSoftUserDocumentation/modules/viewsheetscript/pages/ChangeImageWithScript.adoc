. Select the *Advanced* tab and select ‘Dynamic Image Selection’.

. Press the {buttonValueType} and select ‘Expression’ or ‘Variable’, depending on the mechanism you wish to use to set the image property.

* If you chose ‘Expression’, press the {buttonEdit} and use the Formula Editor to add a script. A typical script might take the following form.  See xref:viewsheet:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc#ControlPropertieswithExpression[Control Properties with Expression] for more details.
+
[source,javascript]
if(condition) {
   'image1.gif';
}
else {
   'image2.gif';
}


* If you chose '`Variable`',  select the Form component that will provide the name of the image.  See xref:viewsheet:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc#ControlPropertieswithFormComponents[Control Properties with Form Components] for more information.

TIP: You can specify an image by the uploaded image name (e.g., `'image1.gif'`), a resource path on the server (e.g., `'/library/image1.gif'`), or a URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/images/logos/ps_logo2.png).


. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor, and then press the btn:[OK] to close the ‘Image Properties’ panel.

The Image component now displays the specified image file.
