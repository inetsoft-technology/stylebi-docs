= Write Back to Database
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

You can configure a Table to be *editable* by users, and create a script that writes user modifications back to the database. The following sections explain how to do this.

[#SetTableEditable]
== Set a Table to be  Editable

An *editable* table is a table whose data can be modified by the user and written back to the database. The following sections explain how to create an Editable Table.

NOTE: An Editable Table is different from an Embedded Table, where the entered data is saved with the underlying Data Worksheet. (See xref:dataworksheet:EnterData.adoc[] for more information about Embedded Tables.)



=== Set a Table as  Editable
To set a table as *editable*, follow the steps below:

. Right-click the Table, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

. Select the *Advanced* tab in the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

. Select the ‘Enable Table Editing’ option, and choose the actions available to the user: ‘Add Rows’, ‘Delete Rows’, and/or ‘Edit Rows’. (See xref:viewsheet:TableProperties.adoc[] for more details.)
+
IMPORTANT: Column editing options are available only if product is licensed for Dashboard Forms.


. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

[#SetEditOptionsforColumn]
=== Set Edit Options for a Column
You can place restrictions on which columns may be edited by users, and what types of values can be entered. To set the editing interface for a particular column, follow the steps below:

. Right-click the column header, and select ‘Column Options’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Column Option’ dialog box.
+
image:viewsheet:Column Option Menu.png[]

. In the ‘Column Option’ dialog box, select ‘Enable Column Editing’ to make the column editable by users.


. In the ‘Column Editor’ menu, select the type of editing control you wish to provide to users. The available options are ‘Text Editor’, ‘ComboBox Editor’, ‘Date Editor’, ‘Number Editor’, ‘Float Editor’, and ‘Boolean Editor’.
+
image:viewsheet:Column Editor Options.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box.

Each type of column editor provides settings which allow you to restrict the values that a user may enter into the column. This allows you to perform validation checking on user input. See xref:#ValidateUserInput[] for the available settings.

You can apply formatting to an editable column in the usual manner (see xref:viewsheet:DataFormat.adoc[]). Formatting is applied to existing column data as well as to any data that a user adds or edits in the column.

=== Set Visibility for a Column
You can choose to hide specific table columns, for example when the table includes a primary key column (used to write data back to the database) that should not be displayed to the user. See xref:viewsheet:AddTable.adoc[] or xref:viewsheet:AddCrosstab.adoc[] for information about how to hide table columns.

To retrieve the value of a hidden column, use the script function xref:TableGetHiddenColumnValue.adoc[]. See xref:#AccessUserModifiedData[] for more details.


[#ValidateUserInput]
==  Validate User Input
You can configure TextInput components and Editable Table columns  with different types of input controls and validation features. (See xref:#SetEditOptionsforColumn[] above for information on how to make a Table editable and set these column options.) The following sections describe the available editors.

=== Boolean Data
The ‘Boolean Editor’ provides the user with a simple checkbox input. This allows the user to enter `true` (checked) or `false` (unchecked) into an Editable Table cell or a TextInput component.

image:viewsheet:Column Boolean Editor.png[]



=== Categorical Data
The ‘ComboBox Editor’ provides the user with standard menu input. This allows a user to simply select a value from a predefined list.

image:viewsheet:Column ComboBox Editor.png[]

To populate the menu from a *manually-created list*, follow these steps:

. In the ‘Column Option’ dialog box, select the ‘Embedded’ option and press btn:[Edit]. This opens the ‘Embedded List Values’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[Add]. This will populate the list with blank ‘Label’ and ‘Value’ fields.

. Double-click on the list elements, and enter a desired ‘Label’ and ‘Value’.

. Repeat the above steps to insert more elements.
+
image:Radio embedded.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box.


To populate the menu from the *Dashboard data source*, follow these steps:

. In the ‘Column Option’ dialog box, select the ‘Query’ option, and press btn:[Edit]. This opens the ‘List Values Selection’ dialog box.

. Select a data block from the list on the left side. Select the appropriate fields from the ‘Label’ and ‘Value’ menus.
+
image:Radio query.png[]

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box.

Enable both the ‘Embedded’ and ‘Query’ options to merge together the values retrieved from both sources into a single list.

=== Date Data
The ‘Date Editor’ provides the user with a pop-up calendar on which to select a date. This allows a user to enter date values into an Editable Table cell or a TextInput component.

image:viewsheet:Column Date Editor.png[]

The following options are available in the dialog box:

Minimum:: Specifies the start date for the permitted time interval. If the user enters a date earlier than the minimum, the error message will be displayed.
Maximum:: Specifies the end date for the permitted time interval. If the user enters a date later than the maximum, the error message will be displayed.
Error Message:: A text message to display when the user enters a date outside the specified interval. The placeholder `pass:[{0}]` can be used to insert the user-entered value at a desired location in the error message. Example error message: `The value you entered, pass:[{0}], is not acceptable.`

=== Decimal Data

The ‘Float Editor’ provides the user with a standard floating point field input. This allows a user to type decimal values into an editable table cell or a TextInput component.

NOTE: Alphabetical characters are not permitted.


image:viewsheet:Column Float Editor.png[]

The following options are available in the dialog box:

Minimum:: Specifies the lowest allowed floating point value. If the user enters a value lower than the minimum, the error message will be displayed.
Maximum:: Specifies the highest allowed floating point value. If the user enters a value higher than the maximum, the error message will be displayed.
Error Message:: A text message to display when the user enters a value outside the specified interval. The placeholder `pass:[{0}]` can be used to insert the user-entered value at a desired location in the error message. Example error message: `The value you entered, pass:[{0}], is not acceptable.`

=== Integer Data


The ‘Integer Editor’ provides the user with standard integer field input. This allows a user to type integer values into an editable table cell or a TextInput component.


NOTE: Alphabetical characters and decimal points are not permitted. To enter decimals, use the Float Editor.

image:Column Number Editor.png[]


The following options are available in the dialog box:

Minimum:: Specifies the lowest allowed integer value. If the user enters a value lower than the minimum, the error message will be displayed.
Maximum:: Specifies the highest allowed integer value. If the user enters a value higher than the maximum, the error message will be displayed.
Error Message:: A text message to display when the user enters a value outside the specified interval. The placeholder `pass:[{0}]` can be used to insert the user-entered value at a desired location in the error message. Example error message: `The value you entered, pass:[{0}], is not acceptable.`

[#Password]
=== Password
The ‘Password Editor’ option is the same as the ‘Text Editor’  option, but masks the entered text using `pass:[****]` characters.  See xref:#TextData[] below.

[#TextData]
=== Text Data
The ‘Text Editor’ provides the user with standard text field input. This allows a user to simply type values into an editable table cell or a TextInput component.

image:Column Text Editor.png[]

To mask the entered text, use the '`Password Editor`' option instead of the ‘Text Editor’ option.

image:Column Password Editor.png[]

The following options are available in the dialog box:

Pattern Check:: Specifies a regular expression (regex) which the input must match. Failure to match the regular expression will cause the error message to be displayed.
Error Message:: A text message to display when the pattern check fails. The placeholder `pass:[{0}]` can be used to insert the user-entered value at a desired location in the error message. Example error message: `The value you entered, pass:[{0}], is not acceptable.`

You can find many regex tutorials and examples on the Internet (e.g., https://www.regular-expressions.info). Some sample expressions and error message combinations are show below:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Pattern Check|Error Message (Suggested)

|pass:[^[a-zA-Z0-9_]*$]|Input can contain only numbers, letters, and underscore (_).
|pass:[\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}]|Input must be a phone number with form pass:[###-###-####].
|pass:[^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{0,15}$]|Input length must be 15 characters or fewer.
|===

The following is a summarization of the regular expression syntax:

[source]
----


Quantified atoms:
{n,m} Match at least n but not more than m times.
{n,} Match at least n times.
{n} Match exactly n times.
* Match 0 or more times.
+ Match 1 or more times.
? Match 0 or 1 times.
a . matches everything except \n
a ^ is a null token matching the beginning of a string or line
(i.e., the position right after a newline or right before the
beginning of a string)
a $ is a null token matching the end of a string or line
(i.e., the position right before a newline or right after
the end of a string)

Character classes (e.g., [abcd]) and ranges (e.g., [a-z])
Special backslashed characters work within a character class
(except for backreferences and boundaries).
\b is backspace inside a character class

Special backslashed characters:
\b null token matching a word boundary (\w on one side and \W
on the other)
\B null token matching a boundary that isn't a word boundary

[#AccessUserModifiedData]
== Access  User-Modified Data
The following sections explain how to access user-modified data so that it can be written back to the database.


=== Access User-Modified Data in Table

include::ROOT:partial$videoVersion.adoc[]
=====

When you configure a Dashboard table to be *editable* (see xref:viewsheet:TableProperties.adoc[]), this allows users to insert, delete, or modify data in the table. Changes that the user makes to the table, however, do not persist after the Dashboard is closed. To allow user modifications to persist beyond the current session, you must commit the modified records to the database. (The following section, xref:#WriteToDatabase[], provides a full example.) The `getFormRows` table function provides you with records that have been modified.

Table1.getFormRows(ADDED):: Provides a two-dimensional array containing the new rows that have been inserted by the user. The length of the array is equal to the number of inserted rows, and the width of the array is equal to the number of columns in the table.

Table1.getFormRows(CHANGED):: Provides a two-dimensional array containing the rows that have been modified by the user. The length of the array is equal to the number of modified rows, and the width of the array is equal to the number of columns in the table.

Table1.getFormRows(DELETED):: Provides a two-dimensional array containing the rows that have been deleted by the user. The length of the array is equal to the number of deleted rows, and the width of the array is equal to the number of columns in the table.

Table1.getFormRow(idx):: Provides the row designated by index `idx`.

These functions are typically called within the onClick handler of a Submit Button (see xref:viewsheet:SubmitButtonProperties.adoc[]).  See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddComponentScript[Add Component Script] for information about the onClick handler.


When a user adds or changes a row in an editable table, the new or modified row is highlighted in color. To clear the highlight on these rows and remove them from the corresponding array returned by `getFormRows`, use the table’s xref:viewsheetscript:TableCommit.adoc[] function.

Table1.commit(ADDED):: Clears highlights on added rows, and removes them from array returned by `getFormRows(ADDED)`.
Table1.commit(CHANGED):: Clears highlight on changed rows, and removes them from array returned by `getFormRows(CHANGED)`.
Table1.commit(DELETED):: Removes deleted rows from array returned by `getFormRows(DELETED)`.
Table1.commit(idx):: Removes the row returned by `getFormRows(idx)` from the array of modified rows.




=== Access User-Modified Data from TextInput
To acquire the data that a user has entered in a TextInput component (see xref:viewsheet:TextInputProperties.adoc[]), simply reference the component’s `value` property:

[source,javascript]
TextInput1.value

To commit this acquired data to the database, see xref:#WriteToDatabase[].

[#AccessMostRecentUserModification]
=== Access Most Recent User Modification
When a user makes a modification to an Editable Table or Form component, the change triggers the Dashboard’s onRefresh Handler script to re-execute. (See xref:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddDashboardScript[Add Dashboard Script] for more information about this handler.) The onRefresh handler offers an xref:viewsheetscript:SpecialFunctionsEvent.adoc[] object that  you can use to detect the user’s action and make an appropriate response. The event object provides access to the following Dashboard event:

For an *Form* Component, the `event` object provides the *name* and *type* of the component in which the user has just made a selection. For an *Editable Table*, the `event` object provides the following properties:

name:: The name of the table component.
type:: The type of the component, always `table`.
row:: The index of the modified row in the table.
column:: The index of the modified column in the table.
source:: A reference to the table object which can be used to access table properties.

.Recalculating table data
[example]
====
The following example illustrates how you can use the xref:SpecialFunctionsEvent.adoc[] object to dynamically update table data in response to user modifications. You will create a table that contains the fields ‘Name’, ‘Price’, ‘Quantity’, and ‘Total’. You will enable the user to modify the ‘Price’ and ‘Quantity’ fields, and use script to automatically update the ‘Total’ field with the corresponding data (i.e., the product of ‘Price’ and ‘Quantity’).

To create this example, follow the steps below:

. Create a new Dashboard based on the ‘Order Model’ data model.
+
[NOTE]
include::ROOT:partial$importAllExamples.adoc[]

. From the *Toolbox* panel, drag a Table component to the Dashboard.

. Expand the ‘Order Model’ node at the top of the *Toolbox* panel, and drag the following fields into the Table component:
+
[source]
Product.Name
Product.Price
Product.Quantity Purchased
Product.Total

. Resize the table as desired.
+
image:UpdateEditableTable1.png[]

. Right-click the table and select ‘Properties’. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Table Properties’ panel.

. Under the *Advanced* tab, select ‘Enable Table Editing’ and press btn:[OK] to close the panel.

. In the table, right-click the ‘Product:Name’ header and select ‘Column Options’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions}

. Deselect the ‘Enable Column Editing’ option, and press ‘OK’. This prevents the user from editing the product name.

. In the table, right-click the ‘Product:Total’ header and select ‘Column Options’ from the context menu.

. Deselect the ‘Enable Column Editing’ option, and press btn:[OK]. This *prevents* the user from manually editing the total. (The total will be calculated by script.)

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the Dashboard toolbar. This opens the ‘Dashboard Options’ panel.

. Select the *Script* tab. Press the ‘onRefresh’ radio button to select the onRefresh handler.

. Enter the following script into the Editor:
+
[source,javascript]
----
if(event != null) {
  var tableObject = event.source;
  var row = event.row;
  var column = event.column;

  if(column == 1 || column == 2) {
    var editedRow = tableObject.getFormRow(row);
    var price = editedRow[1]; // second column = Price
    var quant = editedRow[2]; // third column = Quantity

    if(price != null && quant != null) {
      tableObject.setObject(row, 3, price*quant); // fourth column = Total
    }
    else {
      tableObject.setObject(row, 3,'');
    }
  }
}
----
+
Observe that `event.row` and `event.column` are used together with `getFormRow` to acquire the particular value that the user has entered, and `setObject` is used to write the calculated data into the table.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Script Editor.

. Preview the Dashboard.

Edit various values in the ‘Price’ and ‘Quantity Purchased’ columns, and observe how the ‘Total’ column is automatically updated. Note, however, that changes a user makes to the table (including calculated values) do not persist across sessions unless they are committed to the database. See xref:#WriteToDatabase[] for more details.
====





[#WriteToDatabase]
== Write to Database

The previous section, xref:#AccessUserModifiedData[], described how you can acquire the records in a table which have been modified (inserted, deleted, or changed) by the user. If you want the user’s changes to persist across sessions, you must commit these changes to the database. This is known as database write-back.

.Write back to database...
video::306611787[vimeo,640,400]
include::ROOT:partial$videoVersion.adoc[]
=====

NOTE: A *simpler* way to persistently store user-entered data is by saving the data into a Data Worksheet *Embedded Table* (rather than into a database). See xref:dataworksheet:EnterData.adoc[] and xref:viewsheet:SliderSpinnerProperties.adoc[] for more details.

In most cases, you should commit records to the database by placing a script within the onClick handler of a Submit Button. The script should perform the following operations:

. Create a connection to the database:
+
[source,javascript]
var conn = createConnection('datasource','username','password');
+
If the specified data source does not require credentials, replace the username and password with empty strings (`''`).

. Prepare the desired SQL statement, using placeholders for values to be inserted.
+
[source,javascript]
var pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("insert into table1 values (?,?,?)");
+
The quoted string should be a valid SQL statement which will perform the desired database operation when values are inserted each placeholder (`?`) in the next step.


. Insert values for SQL placeholders. In most cases, these values will be taken from the arrays returned by the table functions `getFormRows(ADDED)`, `getFormRows(CHANGED)`, and `getFormRows(DELETED)`. (See xref:#AccessUserModifiedData[] for more information.)

+
.Example: Insert placeholder values
[source,javascript]
pstmt.setInt(1,rowsAdded[i][0]);    // first substitution
pstmt.setString(2,rowsAdded[i][1]); // second substitution
pstmt.setString(3,rowsAdded[i][2]); // third substitution
+
The integer parameter in each of the above functions is a reference to the corresponding placeholder (`?`) in the SQL statement; for example, the parameter value `1` indicates a substitution for the first `?`, `2` indicates a substitution for the second `?`, and `3` indicates a substitution for the third `?`. The row of the array is indexed by variable `i` above because the array is generally accessed iteratively within a loop structure.

. Update the database tables by executing the SQL statement:
+
[source,javascript]
pstmt.executeUpdate();
+
Note that this does not yet commit any changes to the database. Changes are not committed until the `commit` function is called (next step).

. Commit the changes:
+
[source,javascript]
conn.commit();

. If necessary (in case of an error), roll back the changes:
+
[source,javascript]
conn.rollback();

. Close the connection to the data source:
+
[source,javascript]
conn.close();

The Submit Button onClick script below provides a complete example, which updates a database table with rows which have been added, deleted, and changed.

.Committing user edits to database
[example]
====
The following sample Dashboard, based on the `sales_employees` table in the ‘Orders’ database, contains an editable table with five columns. The Dashboard table, also named `sales_employees`, contains all the columns from `sales_employees` table in the Orders data source.

NOTE: The ‘Orders’ data source in this example is a different from the sample embedded ‘Orders’  database that is used by the examples in  https://github.com/inetsoft-technology/stylebi/blob/main/community-examples/examples.zip[examples.zip].  That database is *not* writable, and cannot be used for this example.


User editing is enabled only for the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `quota` columns. (See xref:viewsheet:TableProperties.adoc[] for details on configuring table and column editing features.)

image:Submit Button Script.png[]


The following script acquires the rows that were added, deleted, or changed, and then commits the modifications back to the database. The script is placed in the onClick handler of the Submit button.

.Example: Submit onClick script
[source,javascript]
----
try{
  // Create the connection to data source (no credentials)
  var conn=createConnection('Orders','','');

  // Find new rows added by user
  var rowsAdded = sales_employees.getFormRows(ADDED);

  // Find existing rows changed by user
  var rowsChanged = sales_employees.getFormRows(CHANGED);

  // Find existing rows deleted by user
  var rowsDeleted = sales_employees.getFormRows(DELETED);

  //---------- ADDING ROWS ----------//
  if(rowsAdded!=null){

    // Iterate through array of added rows
    for(var i = 0; i<rowsAdded.length; i++){

      // Prepare SQL statement with placeholders
      var pstmt=conn.prepareStatement("insert into sales_employees values (?,?,?,?,?)");

      // Insert placeholder values from ith row of array
      pstmt.setInt(1,rowsAdded[i][0]); // row i, column 1
      pstmt.setString(2,rowsAdded[i][1]); // row i, column 2
      pstmt.setString(3,rowsAdded[i][2]); // row i, column 3
      pstmt.setInt(4,rowsAdded[i][3]); // row i, column 4
      pstmt.setInt(5,rowsAdded[i][4]); // row i, column 5

      // Execute the SQL statement
      pstmt.executeUpdate();

      // Commit the changes
      conn.commit();
    }
  }

  //---------- DELETING ROWS ----------//
  if(rowsDeleted!=null){

    // Iterate through array of deleted rows
    for(var i = 0; i<rowsDeleted.length; i++){

      // Prepare SQL statement with placeholders
      var pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("delete from sales_employees where employee_id=?");

      // Insert placeholder value from ith row of array

      // Execute the SQL statement
      pstmt.executeUpdate();

      // Commit the changes
      conn.commit();
    }
  }

  //---------- CHANGING ROWS ----------//

      // Execute the SQL statement
      pstmt.executeUpdate();

      // Commit the changes
      conn.commit();
    }
  }
}

// In case of error, roll-back changes.
