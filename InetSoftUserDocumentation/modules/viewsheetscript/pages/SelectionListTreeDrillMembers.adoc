Returns an array of the levels at which the user has made a selection. The array includes all levels from the top level to one level below the current selection. (The top level is included even when no selection is made.)

NOTE:  drillMembers  does not apply to Selection Lists.



For example, consider a three-level Selection Tree hierarchy: menu:Region[State>City].

image:viewsheet:Selection Tree 3 Level_1.png[]

If the user makes a selection at the level of region, `drillMembers` returns the array `['Region','State']`. If the user makes a selection at the level of state or city, `drillMembers` returns the array `['Region','State','City']`. This array is useful for displaying multiple geographical levels on a map, as shown in the example below.




== Type
Array::			array of field names for selected levels



== Example
Follow the steps below to create a dynamic multi-level map drill:

. Create a new Dashboard based on the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewDashboardNote.adoc[]

+
include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]

. From the *Toolbox* panel, drag a Chart component into the Dashboard. Resize the Chart as desired.

. From the *Toolbox* panel, drag a Selection Tree component into the Dashboard.

. Add a two-level geographical hierarchy to the Selection Tree. Follow the steps below:

.. Expand the ‘Sales’ data block in the *Toolbox* panel.

.. Drag the ‘State’ field from the data block onto the Selection Tree. This adds the ‘State’ values to the tree.

.. Drag the ‘City’ field from the data block onto the Selection Tree. This adds the ‘City’ values to the tree.

.. Resize the Selection Tree so that it can display a reasonable number of options.

. Press the {buttonEdit} on the Chart to open the Visualization Recommender.  Press the {buttonFullEditor} at the top right of the Recommender to bypass the Recommender and open the Chart Editor.

. Press the {buttonSelectChartStyle} in the *Data* panel, and choose the ‘Map’ chart type.

. In the *Data Source* panel, right click on the ‘State’ field, and select ‘Set Geographic’.

. In the *Data Source* panel, right click on the ‘City’ field, and select ‘Set Geographic’.

NOTE: A red question mark indicates that not all cities in the ‘City’ field of this example have mappings.

. From the *Data Source* panel of the Chart Editor, drag the ‘Total’ measure to the ‘Color’ region in the *Visual* panel.

. From the *Data Source* panel of the Chart Editor, drag the ‘State’ dimension to the ‘Geographic’ region in the *Data* panel.

. Configure the Chart to adapt the geographical level based on the user’s selection in the Selection Tree. To do this, follow the steps below:
.. Press the {buttonValueType} button next to the ‘State’ dimension in the *Data* panel. In the pop-up menu, select the ‘Expression’ option.
+

.. Press the {buttonEditFormula} to open the Script Editor.
+
image:commonscript:DrillMembersExample6.png[]

.. In the top-left panel of the Script Editor, expand the `SelectionTree1` node, and click `drillMembers` (*not* `drillMember`). This adds the `SelectionTree1.drillMembers` property in the editing area.
+

+
If the user makes no selection in the Selection Tree, the `drillMembers` property returns the array `['State']`, which displays the ‘Total’ measure on a state-basis. If the user selects one or more states or cities in the Selection Tree, `drillMembers` returns the array `['State','City']`, which displays the ‘Total’ measure on a city-basis.


.. Press btn:[OK] to close the Script Editor. The output of `SelectionTree1.drillMembers` is now assigned to the Chart Geographical binding.
+

. Verify that the map adapts to the user’s selections:

.. Press the {buttonClearSelection} in the Selection Tree to remove any existing selections. Observe that the map represents the measure on a state level, the top level of the Selection Tree hierarchy.
+
image:commonscript:DrillMembersExample10.png[]

.. Select the ‘CA’ option in the Selection Tree. Observe that the Selection Tree filters the map to display only data from California. In addition, the  `drillMembers` property changes the geographical binding to represent the ‘City’ dimension, and the measure is now displayed at the city-level.

To automatically zoom a map to display only the regions that the user selects, see the example for Coordinate.setFullMap(boolean).
