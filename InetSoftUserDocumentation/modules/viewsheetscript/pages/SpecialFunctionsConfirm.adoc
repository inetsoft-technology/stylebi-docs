xref:SpecialFunctionsAlert.adoc[] to display a no-choice  message to the user.

The `confirm()` function opens a dialog box to provide the user with a choice to continue or cancel an operation. For example, you can use the `confirm()` function in the *onClick* script of a ‘Submit’ button to verify the user’s intention to submit. (See xref:viewsheet:SubmitButtonProperties.adoc[] for more information.)

The `confirm()` function does not suspend script processing. Rather, a script containing the confirm function is automatically executed either once or twice:

. On the first execution of the script, the property `confirmEvent.confirmed` is set to `false`.

. On the second execution of the script, which occurs only if the user presses btn:[Yes] in the ‘Confirm’ dialog box, the property `confirmEvent.confirmed` is set to `true`.

This repeated script execution allows you to invoke different operations depending on the user’s response to the confirmation prompt. For example, the script below asks the user to confirm that they want to continue submission even though they have not provided values for both TextInput components.

.Submit onClick example: Confirm incomplete submission
[source,javascript]
if(!confirmEvent.confirmed) {
  if((TextInput1.value==null) || (TextInput2.value==null)) {
    confirm('You have not entered all values.  Continue?')
  }
}
else {
  parameter.val1 = TextInput1.value;
  parameter.val2 = TextInput2.value;
  alert('Input has been submitted.')
}

The script executes a first time when a user presses the ‘Submit’ button. During this first execution, `confirmEvent.confirmed` is `false`, so the TextInput values are tested and the ‘Confirm’ dialog box is generated.

If the user presses btn:[No], the dialog box is closed and no action is taken. If the user presses btn:[Yes], the script executes a *second time* with `confirmEvent.confirmed` now set to `true`, which commences the action in the `else` block. (In this case, the desired action is simply to assign the TextInput values to corresponding Dashboard parameters.)
