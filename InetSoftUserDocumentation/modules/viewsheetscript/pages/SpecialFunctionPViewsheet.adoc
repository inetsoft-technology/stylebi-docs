For a Dashboard that is accessed via drilldown (hyperlink or auto-drill) from another Dashboard, the `pviewsheet` property provides access to the current settings of components within the parent Dashboard. See xref:viewsheet:DrillDownIntoData.adoc[] in xref:viewsheet:VisualizeYourData.adoc[] for more information about hyperlinks.

For example, if the parent Dashboard contains a Selection List named ‘Company’, you can obtain the array of currently selected companies in the ‘Company’ Selection List within the drilldown Dashboard script by using the following syntax:

[source,javascript]
pviewsheet.Company.selectedObjects
