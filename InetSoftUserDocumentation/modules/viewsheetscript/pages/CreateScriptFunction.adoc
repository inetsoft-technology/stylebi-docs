= Create a Custom Function
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

In addition to using  predefined JavaScript functions (see xref:commonscript:UserFunctions.adoc[]), you also can create your own functions. A custom function  is a reusable component that can be applied in  multiple   Dashboards. By saving common script tasks to the script library, you can keep your main scrips short, simple, and easy to maintain. The following sections explain how to create and use a custom script function.

The Script Library is independent of any  particular Dashboard. You do not need to open a  Dashboard in order to access the Script Library.



[#AddFunctiontoScriptLibrary]
== Add a Function to the Script Library
The Script Library is a collection of functions, which can be called from any  Dashboard with access to the Library. To add a new function to the library, follow the steps below.


. Log into the User Portal. (See xref:user:UsePortal.adoc[].)
+
include::user:partial$createVisualizationStep3.adoc[]

. In the User Portal, press the {buttonCreate} and select the {buttonCreateDashboard} or {buttonWorksheet} option.

. Expand the '`Library`' folder, and right-click the '`Script`' folder. {rightClickOptions} Select '`New Script Function`'.

. Enter the desired function script, beginning with `function` keyword.  You can use the built-in functions provided in the '`JavaScript Functions`' and '`Excel Functions`' folders on the left side.

+
Any parameters (e.g., col) should be placed in a comma-separated list inside the parentheses that follow the function name. These parameters can then be used inside the function body. Since JavaScript does not support type declaration, parameters are not qualified with types.
+
TIP: Note in the above function that the property `table` is not qualified by a component ID (e.g., `Table1.table`). Functions are scoped dynamically; therefore, the property `table` refers to whichever Table component called the `tableTotal()` function. You can therefore call this `tableTotal()` function from within any Table xref:viewsheetscript:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddComponentScript[component script] to operate on that particular Table component. See xref:#FunctionScope[] below   for more information.

. *_Optional_*: Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to set the following propeties:
+
Font Size:: Font size for all scripts in the Editor.
Content:: A description for the script currently being edited.


. Press  the {buttonSave} in the  toolbar. Enter a valid name for the function. A function name should begin with an uppercase or lowercase letter, followed by letters, digits, or ‘_’. No spaces or other special characters should be used.

. Press btn:[OK]. This saves the function into the Script Library.



== Edit a Function in the Script Library

To edit a function in the library, follow the steps below.

. Log into the User Portal. (See xref:user:UsePortal.adoc[].)
+
include::user:partial$createVisualizationStep3.adoc[]

. In the User Portal, press the {buttonCreate} and select the {buttonCreateDashboard} or {buttonWorksheet} option.
+
image:viewsheet:portalDesignTab.png[]


. Expand the '`Library`' folder and  the '`Script`' folder. Double-click the function that you want to edit. {rightClickOptions}
+
image:customFunction3.png[]

. Edit and save the function as described in xref:#AddFunctiontoScriptLibrary[].

. *_Optional_*: To *delete* a function, right-click the function in the '`Scripts`' folder, and select '`Remove`'. {rightClickOptions}

[#FunctionScope]
== Function Scope
Function scoping is dynamic. This means that the scope in which the function executes is the scope of the *function caller*. For example, if a function is called from the scope of a xref:viewsheetscript:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc#AddComponentScript[component script] on the   "`Table1`", then all the properties of  Table1 are available to the function. Properties that are not qualified with an element ID (e.g., `table`, `visible`, as opposed to `TableX.table`, `TableX.visible`) refer to the *caller*, Table1.

This scope rule means that if a variable is not declared within a function, the script engine will try to find it in the enclosing scopes. Exactly which object will be located depends on where the function is called. To avoid ambiguity, when you use a variable in a function, you should either declare it inside the function, or pass it in as a parameter.
