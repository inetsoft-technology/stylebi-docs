Returns the Flyover View conditions that are currently in effect on a filtered component. The `dataConditions` property provides an array of attributes, `attr[]`, and an array of values, `value[]`, that contain the conditions for all flyover filters currently being applied to a specified component.

== Type
dataConditions.attr[]::					Array of filtered dimension labels
dataConditions.value[]::					Array of filtered dimension values

== Example
Consider a Chart that uses a flyover view to filter a Table named “Query1”. If the ‘On Click Only’ option is set for the Chart flyover (and therefore multiple Chart groups can be selected in the flyover), the Table’s `dataConditions.attr[]` and `dataConditions.value[]` arrays will each contain one item for every group the user selects on the Chart. You can iterate through these arrays to obtain the currently selected dimensions and values.

The script below is placed in the *Script* tab of the Table component (“Query1”) that is being filtered, and modifies the `title` property of the Table.

.Example: Set title to display current flyover filter
[source,javascript]
var conds = Query1.dataConditions;
var txt = 'Filter: None';
if(!isNull(conds)) {
  txt = 'Filter: ' + conds[0].attr + ' = ';
  for(var i=0;i<conds.length;i++) {
    txt += conds[i].value;
    if(i != conds.length-1) {
      txt += ', '
     }
  }
}
Query1.title = txt;


NOTE: This script could also be written as an expression for the ‘Title’ property in the *General* tab.

When the user selects groups on the Chart, the Table’s title bar indicates the current flyover filter applied to the Table.
