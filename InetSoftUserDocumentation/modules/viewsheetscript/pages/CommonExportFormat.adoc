Returns the format in which a Dashboard is currently being exported: `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `html`, `png`. This property can be used to control the *visibility* of a component during export by placing it within an Expression  that sets the ‘Visible’ property of a component.

The `exportFormat` property obtains a value only when the Dashboard is actively being exported. At all other times, the value is `null`.

NOTE: If you want a component have same the visibility setting for *all export types*, it is simpler to use the ‘Hide on Print and Export’ setting of the component’s ‘Visible’ property. See xref:viewsheet:GeneralTab.adoc[] for more information.
