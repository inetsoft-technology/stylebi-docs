=  Reference Query Data
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

Once you have executed the query (xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[]), you can access specific ranges of the query result set. The data-referencing syntax explained in the following sections allows you to also group and filter the results, and to create expressions.

== Reference  Freehand Table Cells
Typically, when you access query data using the methods described below, you will display this data within the cells of a Freehand Table.  (See xref:viewsheet:AddFreehandTable.adoc[]) for more information about this component. The following sections provide several examples of how to do this.

Note that you can assign a name to any cell within a Freehand Table. This allows you to use the cell’s name to reference the value of the cell from within another formula. Refer to the value in a cell by using syntax `$cell_name`, where `cell_name` is the name assigned in the ‘Cell Name’ field for the cell being referenced.

image:viewsheet:Freehand Table Cell Reference_1.png[]

You can insert this reference easily by selecting the field name from the ‘Cell’ folder in the editor.

== Extract a Query Column
To run a query in script, see xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[]. To retrieve an array of all values in a given field (column) from the query result set `q`, use the field name:

[source,javascript]
q['state'];

The following example illustrates this approach.

.Reference query column
[example]
====
Consider the sample ‘customers’ query. In this example, you will extract all the values under the ‘state’ column and use them to populate a Freehand table. Follow the steps below.

include::ROOT:partial$customersQuery.adoc[]

. Press the {buttonCreate} in the Visual Composer toolbar and select {buttonNewDashboard}. This opens the ‘New Dashboard’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box and create the new Dashboard. (Do not select any data source.)

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the Dashboard toolbar, and select the *Script* tab. Select the ‘onInit’ option at the bottom and enter the following script:
+

[source,javascript]
var q = runQuery('ws:global:Examples/customers')


+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp1.png[]
+
This executes the ‘customers’ query in the onInit script. (See xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[] for more details.)

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ dialog box.

. Drag the ‘Freehand Table’ component from the *Toolbox* panel into the Dashboard. This opens the Table Editor.

. Click on cell[1,0] in the Table (second row, first column) to select it.

. Select the ‘Formula’ option and press the btn:[Edit] button.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp2.png[]


. Enter the following formula in the Formula Editor:
+
 q['state']
+
This extracts the entire ‘state’ column from the ‘customers’ query to populate the table.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor.

. Select ‘Expand Cell’ and choose ‘Vertical’. (This causes the extracted data to fill down vertically.)
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp3.png[]
+
Observe that the table is populated with all the records from the ‘state’ column of the ‘customers’ query.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp4.png[]
+
To return just the unique values in the ‘state’ column, change the script from `q['state']` to `toList(q['state'])`.
+

[#DeriveDatafromQueryColumns]
== Derive Data from Query Columns
To run a query in script, see xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[]. In some cases you may want to perform operations on existing query columns to obtain the desired result. To do this, modify the formula by placing ‘`=`’ in front of the expression string. The following example illustrates this approach.

.Derive Data from Query Columns
[example]
====
Consider the sample ‘customers’ Data Worksheet. In this example, you will create a derived result that concatenates the value in the ‘state’ field with the value in the ‘zip’ field within a Freehand Table. Follow the steps below.

include::ROOT:partial$customersQuery.adoc[]

. Press the {buttonCreate} in the Visual Composer toolbar and select {buttonNewDashboard}. This opens the ‘New Dashboard’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box and create the new Dashboard. (Do not select a data source.)

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the Dashboard toolbar, and select the *Script* tab. Select the ‘onInit’ option at the bottom and enter the following script:
+

[source,javascript]
var q = runQuery('ws:global:Examples/customers')

+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp1.png[]
+
This executes the ‘customers’ data block in the onInit script. (See xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[] for more details.)

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ panel.

. Drag the ‘Freehand Table’ component from the *Toolbox* panel into the Dashboard. This opens the Table Editor.

. Click on cell[1,0] in the table (second row, first column) to select it.

. Select the ‘Formula’ option and press the btn:[Edit] button.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp2_1.png[]

. Enter the following formula in the Formula Editor:
+
[source,javascript]
q['=state + ", " + zip'];

+
This concatenates the values in the ‘state’ column with the corresponding values in the ‘zip’ column.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor.

. Select ‘Expand Cell’ and choose ‘Vertical’. (This causes the extracted data to fill down vertically.)
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp6.png[]
+
Observe that the table is populated with the concatenated values of ‘state’ and ‘zip’.

[#ExtractQueryDatawithFieldFiltering]
== Extract Query Data with Field Filtering
You can filter values of a field (column) based on the values of other fields in the result set. To do this, use ‘`@`’ as the delimiter between the column name and the filtering expression and ‘`:`’ to introduce the values to filter. For example, to extract all values in a ‘company_name’ field where the corresponding value in the ‘state’ field is ‘NJ’, use the following formula:

[source,javascript]
q['company_name@state:NJ'];

This will yield a list of all the companies in New Jersey.

NOTE: To retrieve a sub-table rather than an array, add an initial asterisk: `q['*@state:NJ'];`

To filter based on multiple fields, use ‘`;`’ as the delimiter between the filtering expressions. For example, to find all the companies within a certain city (New Brunswick) and state (NJ), adapt the formula as follows:

[source,javascript]
q['company_name@state:NJ;city:New Brunswick'];

If the filtering expression is based on a derived field (xref:#DeriveDatafromQueryColumns[]), place ‘`=`’ in front of the expression. For example, to find all the companies within a certain ‘state, zip’ pair, adapt the formula as follows:

[source,javascript]
q['company_name@=state + ", " + zip:NJ, 08854'];

If the column name contains a space, use the `rowValue` operator:

[source,javascript]
q['company_name@=rowValue["US State"] + ", " + zip:NJ, 08854'];

The above examples use literal values (e.g., ‘NJ’, ‘New Brunswick’) in the condition. To use cell references in place of literal values, see xref:#ReferenceCellforColumnFiltering[].

== Extract Query Data with Expression Filtering
You can filter values in a column based on a conditional expression. Use `?` as the delimiter between the filtering expression and the column name. For example, to extract all the values in the ‘company_name’ field where the corresponding value in the ‘customer_id’ field is between 20 and 30, use the following formula:

[source,javascript]
q['company_name?customer_id &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; customer_id &lt; 30'];

Note, however, that while expression filtering can often be used to achieve the same result as field filtering, field filtering is better optimized. See xref:#ExtractQueryDatawithFieldFiltering[] for more details.

== Extract Query Data with Index Filtering
You can filter values in a column based on a range of row indexes. For example, to extract the first five records from a ‘company_name’ column, use the following formula:

[source,javascript]
q['[0,company_name]:[4, company_name]'];

An asterisk ‘`*`’ in place of the row index represents the last row in the result set.


[#ReferenceCellforColumnFiltering]
== Filter Query Based on Cell Value
When extracting data from a query, you can use cell references as the filtering parameters. This is particularly useful when the table has multiple levels of row/column headers, and you want to filter the child level based on the parent level.

.Walkthrough
[example]
====
In this example, you will create a Freehand Table (based on the ‘customers’ query) with a two-level row header consisting of states and the cities within each state. Follow the steps below:

. Press the {buttonCreate} in the Visual Composer toolbar and select {buttonNewDashboard}. This opens the ‘New Dashboard’ dialog box.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the dialog box to create the new Dashboard. (Do not select any data source in the ‘New Dashboard’ dialog box.)

. Press the {buttonOptions} in the toolbar, and select the *Script* tab. Select the ‘onInit’ option at the bottom and enter the following script:
+

[source,javascript]
var q = runQuery('ws:global:Examples/customers')

+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp1.png[]
+
This executes the ‘customers’ data block in the onInit script. (See xref:RunQueryFromScript.adoc[] for more details.)

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Dashboard Options’ panel.

. Drag the ‘Freehand Table’ component from the *Toolbox* panel into the Dashboard. Press the {buttonEdit} to open the Table Editor.

. Right-click on the rightmost column and select ‘Append Column’ from the menu. The table should now have three columns.

. Right-click on the bottom row and select ‘Insert Rows/Columns’ from the menu. Insert two rows at the bottom of the table.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp8.png[]
+
The table should now have four rows and three columns.

. Click on cell[1,0] in the Table (second row, first column) to select it.

. Select the ‘Formula’ option and press the btn:[Edit] button.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp2_2.png[]

. Enter the following formula in the Formula Editor:
+
[source,javascript]
q['state']
+
This extracts the entire ‘state’ column from the ‘customers’ query to populate the table.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the Formula Editor.

. Select ‘Expand Cell’ and choose ‘Vertical’. (This causes the extracted data to fill down vertically.)
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp3_1.png[]

. In the ‘Cell Name’ field, enter ‘`st`’ as the cell name.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp9.png[]

. Select cell[1,1] in the table (second row, second column).

. Select the ‘Formula’ option, and enter the following formula in the Formula Editor:
+
[source,javascript]
q['city']
+
This extracts the entire ‘city’ column from the ‘customers’ query.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp10.png[]

. Select ‘Expand Cell’ and choose ‘Vertical’.

. In the ‘Cell name’ field, enter ‘`ct`’ as the cell name.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp11.png[]

. {finishEditing} Observe that the table is now populated with states and cities.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp12.png[]
+
However, the second column lists *all* the cities next to each state, not only the cities that reside within the specific state. To filter the cities based on the state values, include a field-filtering condition with a reference to the cell ‘`st`’, as described below.

. Press the {buttonEdit} in the Table title bar to reopen the Table Editor.

. Select cell[1,1] and change the formula from `q['city']` to `q['city@state:$st']`. This returns only values from the ‘city’ field where the corresponding ‘state’ value is equal to the value in the table cell named ‘`st`’.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp13.png[]
+
NOTE: When making comparisons with 'null', use the syntax `$st['.']` to reference the cell value.

. {finishEditing} View the resulting table.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp14.png[]
+
Notice that the table now lists only those cities that correspond to the given state. To further restrict the table’s data to display only unique values of city and state (i.e., to remove duplicates), modify the two formulas to use the `toList()` function:
+
[source,javascript]
----
// Cell[1,0]:
toList(q['state'])

// Cell[1,1]:
toList(q['city@state:$st'])
----

[#ReferenceCellsinSummaryFormulas]
== Use Cell Values in Summary Formulas
This section provides an example of using cell references in summary formulas.

.Walkthrough
[example]
====
Consider the formula table from the example in xref:#ReferenceCellforColumnFiltering[]. It consists of a two-level row header listing states and cities within each state. In the following example, you will add a formula to count the number of customers within each city.

. Press the {buttonEdit} in the Table title bar to reopen the Table Editor.

. Select cell[1,2] (second row, third column), select the ‘Formula’ option, and add the following formula:
+
[source,javascript]
count(q['customer_id@state:$st;city:$ct'])
+
This formula counts all the customers within the given city and state.

. Select the ‘Expand Cell’ option and choose the ‘Vertical’ option.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp15.png[]

. {finishEditing} The Table now displays a count of customer IDs within each city and state.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp16.png[]
====

== Group Numbering
To obtain the sequence number of an element within an expanding cell, use the ‘`#`’ qualifier. (This is useful when you wish to add numbering to row/column headers.)

.Group numbering
[example]
====
Consider the Freehand Table from the example in xref:#ReferenceCellsinSummaryFormulas[]. You will now add numbering for the expanding row header cell ‘`st`’.

. Press the {buttonEdit} in the Table title bar to reopen the Table Editor.

. Right-click any cell in the first column and select menu:Column[ Insert Column] from the context menu. This adds a new column to the left.

. Select cell[1,0] (second row) in the newly inserted column, select the ‘Formula’ option, and add the following formula:
+
[source,javascript]
$st['#'] + 1
+
Do not set any cell expansion. Note that group indexing starts with 0. The formula adds 1 to the index so that the first group has value 1.

. {finishEditing} The table now displays the state group number in the first column. (You may need to resize the table to see all the columns.)
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp17.png[]
+
Note that the groups numbers are repeated for each instance of the state. To merge these repeated instances together, continue with the steps below.

. Press the {buttonEdit} in the Table title bar to reopen the Table Editor.

. Select cell[1,0] (second row, first column).

. Select the *Option* tab. Enable ‘Merge expanded cells’, and select ‘`st`’ from the ‘Row Group’ menu.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp18.png[]

. Select cell[1,1] (second row, second column).

. In the bottom left panel, enable ‘Merge expanded cells’ and select ‘`st`’ from the ‘Row Group’ menu.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp19.png[]

. {finishEditing} Note how repeated states and group numbers have been merged together.
+
image:viewsheet:freehandExp20.png[]

. To vertically align these values within their cells, click on a cell to select it, and select the *Format* tab in the left panel if Visual Composer. Choose ‘Middle’ from the ‘Vertical Alignment’ property.
+

== Reference a Cell with Relative Parent Group
Relative cell referencing is used primarily when comparing different summary cells with respect to their header cell. For example, you might want to find the difference between the total sales for the current year and the previous year. The syntax for relative cell referencing is as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
$cellName['grpName:+/-relative_index']

// Examples:
$sales['state:-1']
$sales['yr:+1']
----

Here, `$cellName` is the name of the cell/column containing the value(s) to be compared, and `grpName` is name of the cell/column that indexes the different values.
