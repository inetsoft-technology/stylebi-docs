= Add Script to a Dashboard
%experimental%
include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

There are three levels at which you can attach script in a Dashboard:

Property level:: Attach script as a property expression to dynamically modify property values (e.g., visibility, color, etc.) of the host component. See xref:#AddPropertyScript[].

Component level:: Attach script to an individual component (Chart, Gauge, etc.) to modify component properties, including properties that cannot be set by an expression, or to implement other logic. See xref:#AddComponentScript[].
Dashboard level:: Attach script in one of two global domains, the *onInit* handler or the *onRefresh* handler. See xref:#AddDashboardScript[] for more information.

The following sections explain how and where you can add script to your Dashboard.

== Script Evaluation Order
Unlike conventional JavaScript on web pages, JavaScript that you embed in a Dashboard is executed as part of the Dashboard generation process on the server, not the client browser. However, scripts can control client-side interactions through event handlers and hyperlinks. The overall sequence of Dashboard script evaluation is as follows.

1: Execute the *onInit* handler:: The onInit handler executes only once, when the Dashboard is first loaded. It can be used to initialize variables and define parameters.  See xref:#AddDashboardScript[] for more information.

2: Execute the *onRefresh* handler:: The onRefresh handler re-executes each time the Dashboard is refreshed by a user operation. See xref:#AddDashboardScript[] for more information.


4: Execute all *component-level* scripts:: Component scripts and property expressions are re-executed whenever the particular component is refreshed due to a user operation (on the component itself, or on a related component).  See xref:#AddPropertyScript[] xref:#AddComponentScript[] and for more information. For a given component, property expressions are  evaluated prior to the component script.
+
CAUTION: Because the order in which individual component scripts are initially executed is *undetermined*, you should avoid setting properties of one component from within a script attached to a different component.  *In general*, components scripts are evaluated starting from the top of the Dashboard.

== Access Java in Script
You can call both JavaScript and Java functions from within Dashboard scripts. However, scripts are executed in a restricted environment that provides access only to the following Java packages: `java.awt`, `java.text`, `java.util`, `java.sql`, `inetsoft.graph.*,` `inetsoft.report`, `inetsoft.report.lens`, `inetsoft.report.filter`, `inetsoft.uql`, and `inetsoft.report.painter`.

To permit scripts to access Java packages other than those listed, an administrator can set the `javascript.java.packages` property to specify additional packages. ({EMPropertyConfig}) To add package contents to the current namespace, use `importPackage('packageName')`. For example, `importPackage('java.lang')` or `importPackage(java.lang)` allows scripts to refer to object names without full qualification (i.e., `String` rather than `java.lang.String`).

[#AddPropertyScript]
== Add Property Expression Script


You can enter a script in any property field that provides the {buttonValueType} with an ‘Expression’ option.

To add a script to a component expression field, follow the steps below:

. Right-click the component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. This opens the ‘Properties’ panel. {rightClickOptions}
+
image:viewsheet:Right Click Properties.png[]

. In the ‘Properties’ panel, find the property you want to dynamically change. (The ‘Visible’ property under the *General* tab in this example.)

. Press the {buttonValueType} next to the property you want to modify, and select ‘Expression’ from the menu. This enables the {buttonEditFormula}.
+
image:viewsheet:Expression Option.png[]

. Press the {buttonEditFormula} to open the Formula Editor.
+
image:viewsheet:Edit Expression Button.png[]


. In the Formula Editor, enter the desired script. (Enter properties such as `RadioButton1.selectedObject` and parameters such as `pass:[parameter._USER_]` by selecting them from the top panel of the Editor.) For example, the following script hides the component if the user has selected ‘Hide’ from a RadioButton control, and the current month is March (i.e., the third month).
+
.Example: Hide   component
[source,javascript]
if ((RadioButton1.selectedObject=='Hide') && (CALC.today().getMonth() == 3)) {
   "Hide"
}
else {
   "Show"
}

+
TIP: The script must return one of the options in the property menu. For example, return values for the ‘Visible’ property must be one of `"Show"`, `"Hide"`, or `"Hide on Print and Export"`. (To achieve “*Show* on Print and Export” behavior, use the special expression `"!visible"`.)

* An expression script can reference properties of its hosting component without full qualification. For example, in a script placed on component Chart1, `Chart1.selectedObject` and `selectedObject` refer to the same property.

* Expressions must always return permissible values for the corresponding property. For example, if a property requires an integer, an expression that sets that property must evaluate to an integer. If a property requires one of a fixed set of options, e.g., ‘Rows’ or ‘Columns’, then the expression that sets that property must evaluate identically to one of those strings (`'Rows'` or `'Columns'`). See xref:viewsheet:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] for more information about required return values.

[#AddComponentScript]
== Add Component Script

A script attached to a Dashboard component is evaluated whenever the component is refreshed, such as upon Dashboard loading and user interactions. The script can change various properties of the component, including its visibility. Properties set in script override  properties set (either statically or via expression script) in the component ‘Properties’ dialog box.


TIP: A component`'s script can access other components`' properties as well. However, it is *not* good practice to modify the properties of one component from within the script of another component, as the evaluation order is dependent on component positioning.


The following sections explain how to add component script, and illustrate some common uses.

=== Attach Script to Component
To attach a script to a Dashboard component, follow the steps below.

. Right-click the desired component, and select ‘Properties’ from the context menu. {rightClickOptions} This opens the ‘Properties’ panel.

. Select the *Script* tab to open the Script Editor.


. Select the *Script* or *onClick*  button at the bottom of the dialog box.
+
image:viewsheet:ScriptEditorText.png[]
+
CAUTION: Do not attach an *onClick* script to a component that already has a *hyperlink*.


. Type the desired script in the text field, and press btn:[OK].
+
Select functions and operators from the top-right panel or use the ‘Search’ box. See xref:viewsheetscript:DashboardObjectReference.adoc[] and xref:commonscript:UserFunctions.adoc[] for available functions. To enter properties such as `RadioButton1.selectedObject`, parameters such as `pass:[parameter._USER_]`, or data such as `data['Count(Order Number)']`,  select these options in the top-left panel of the Editor, or use the ‘Search’ box.
+
TIP:  An expression script can reference properties of its hosting component without full qualification. For example, in a script placed on component Chart1, `Chart1.selectedObject` and `selectedObject` refer to the same property.

+
See  the  sections below for commonly scripted properties.

. *_Optional:_*  To disable a script (without deleting it entirely), uncheck the ‘Enable Script’ option at the bottom right corner of the Script Editor.

Components with script have a {buttonJS} in the top-left corner. Press the button to open the script in the Script Editor.

=== Color Property
Color properties (foreground/text and background/fill) are frequently used to highlight a Text or Textbox element. The simplest way to specify a color property is to assign a string containing one of the constants from the https://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/awt/Color.html[java.awt.Color] class: `black`, `blue`, `cyan`, `darkGray`, `gray`, `green`, `lightGray`, `magenta`, `orange`, `pink`, `red`, `white`, and `yellow`.

.Example: Color constant
[source,javascript]
foreground = 'red';


You can also specify a color as `java.awt.Color` object, an integer (e.g., hexadecimal) representing the RGB value of a color, an array of RGB values, or a https://json.org/[JSON] object.

.Example: Other valid color specifications
[source,javascript]
foreground = java.awt.Color.red; // class name must be fully qualified
background = 0xFF0000; // RRGGBB
foreground = [255, 0, 0];
foreground = {r:255,g:0,b:0};

Alternatively, you can create a color object by calling the constructor with the `new` operator.

.Example: Constructor
[source,javascript]
foreground = new java.awt.Color(0.5, 1, 0);

Note that the parameters to the color constructor have type *float*. Because JavaScript treats all numbers as float by default, you have to explicitly convert them to integer if you want to specify the RGB values in the range of 0-255. The default float parameters pass the RGB value in the range of 0-1, where 1 is equivalent to 255 in the integer version.

=== Font Property
[WARNING,caption=See Also]
xref:commonscript:StyleConstant.adoc[] for commonly-used constant values.

You can specify the font property with a string containing the font name, style, and size, separated by dashes, or by creating a {javaawtfont} object.

.Example: Font specification
[source,javascript]
font = 'Verdana-BOLD-12';
font = new java.awt.Font('Verdana', java.awt.Font.BOLD, 12);

The name of the font can be a TrueType font name, or a logical font name. Logical font names are *not recommended*, however, because the logical font may be replaced by a different font in the runtime environment.

There are three font styles, `Font.PLAIN`, `Font.BOLD` and `Font.ITALIC`. The styles can be combined with a bitwise `OR`.

.Example: Style combination
[source,javascript]
font = new java.awt.Font('Verdana', java.awt.Font.BOLD | java.awt.Font.ITALIC, 12);

The final parameter specifies the size of the font. InetSoft provides an *extended font* that supports additional styles:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Font Style|Description

|Underline|Draw an underline below the text. The line style should be an available xref:commonscript:StyleConstant.adoc#LineStyle[Line Style].
|Strikethrough|Draw a line through the text in the middle.
|Superscript|Draw the text at the upper corner of the previous text.
|Subscript|Draw the text at the lower corner of the previous text.
|Smallcaps|Draw all letters in capital letter, but draw the lowercase letters in a smaller size.
|Allcaps|Convert all letters to uppercase.
|Shadow|Draw the text with a shadow effect.
|===

To create an extended font, you must use the fully qualified name of {InetsoftReportStyleFont} class.

.Example: Extended font
[source,javascript]
font = new inetsoft.report.StyleFont('Verdana', java.awt.Font.BOLD | inetsoft.report.StyleFont.UNDERLINE, 12, StyleConstant.THIN_LINE);

The final parameter specifies the line style used to draw the underline.

=== Visibility
You can dynamically hide or show a component using script. Typically, you would test a condition or user input at runtime, and then hide one or more components to present an appropriate view.

.Example: Visibility
[source,javascript]

if(field['discount'] == 0) {
  Text8.visible = false;
}

As for all component properties, you should change the visibility of a component only from within a script attached to the *same* component , or from within the onRefresh Handler. (See xref:#AddDashboardScript[] for more information about this handler.) Otherwise, the position  of the component in the Dashboard may influence the outcome.

=== Alignment
[WARNING,caption=See Also]
====
[square]
* xref:commonscript:StyleConstant.adoc[] for commonly-used constant values.
* xref:viewsheet:TextProperties.adoc[], for more information about Text properties.
====
The Alignment property controls both the horizontal and vertical alignment of the component. The horizontal alignment is specified by the alignment constants `H_LEFT`, `H_CENTER`, and `H_RIGHT`. (See xref:commonscript:StyleConstant.adoc#Alignment[Alignment] for more details.)

[source,javascript]
alignment = StyleConstant.H_CENTER;

The vertical alignment property can be combined with the horizontal alignment property by using the bitwise `OR`.

[source,javascript]
alignment = StyleConstant.H_CENTER | StyleConstant.V_CENTER;

The four vertical alignment options are `V_TOP`, `V_CENTER`, `V_BOTTOM`, and `V_BASELINE`.

[#AddDashboardScript]
== Add Dashboard-Level Script

To create a Dashboard script, follow the steps below:

. Press {buttonOptions} in the toolbar to open the ‘Dashboard Options’ panel.

. Select the *Script* tab. This opens the Script Editor.
+
image:viewsheet:ViewsheetOptionsDialog.png[]

. Use the radio buttons at the bottom to select either *onInit* or *onRefresh*.
+
****
onInit:: A Dashboard’s *onInit* script is executed only once, when the Dashboard it first loaded. It is ideal for one-time initialization tasks, such as defining Dashboard parameters and variables. A variable declared in onInit script will have *global* scope, and be accessible to all individual component scripts. To declare a local variable with the same name elsewhere, use the `var` keyword in the declaration to remove ambiguity.
onRefresh:: The *onRefresh* handler is similar to the onInit handler, and is executed following onInit upon Dashboard loading. However, unlike onInit, an onRefresh script is executed *every time* the Dashboard is refreshed. Because the Dashboard is refreshed in response to most user interactions, including selections, the onRefresh handler gives you the ability to dynamically modify multiple elements from a central location. A variable declared in onRefresh script will have *global* scope, and will be accessible to individual component scripts. To declare a local variable with the same name elsewhere, use the `var` keyword in the declaration to remove ambiguity.
+
NOTE: The onRefresh script does not execute when you refresh a Preview by clicking the *Preview* tab. To run the onRefresh script, press the {buttonPreview} in the toolbar.
****

. Enter the desired script, and press btn:[OK]. (Enter properties such as `RadioButton1.selectedObject` or parameters such as `pass:[parameter._USER_]` by selecting these options in the top panel of the Editor or by using the ‘Search’ box.)

. To temporarily disable a script (without deleting it entirely), uncheck the ‘Enable Script’ option at the bottom right  of the Script Editor.

== Add Chart Script
Charts offer many properties that can be accessed in script. See  xref:viewsheetscript:DashboardObjectReference.adoc[] for a list of available properties. Charts also provide an extensive API that allows you to modify an existing chart or create a new chart entirely through script. For more information on the Chart API, see xref:chartAPI:ChartScriptTutorial.adoc[] and xref:chartAPI:ChartScriptReference.adoc[].
