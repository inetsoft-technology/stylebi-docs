= isCancelled()

include::ROOT:partial$buttonSnippets.adoc[]

Returns `true` if the user has pressed the btn:[Cancel] button during Dashboard loading, otherwise returns `false`.

This function allows a long-running script to be terminated by a user btn:[Cancel] action. If a script does not check the `isCancelled` status and self-terminate, the Dashboard cannot be canceled by user action until the script has run to completion.

== Example
[source,javascript]
for(var i = 0; i < 100000 && !isCancelled(); i++) {
  // statement to execute
  // statement to execute
  //...
  // statement to execute
}
