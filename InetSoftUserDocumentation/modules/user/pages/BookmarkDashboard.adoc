A bookmark allows you save your current Dashboard settings (filter selections, menu choices, annotations, etc.) so that you can return to these settings at a later time. The following sections explain how to work with bookmarks.

NOTE: Bookmarks store only settings, *not* data. See xref:viewsheet:AddAnnotation.adoc[] to save annotations with a bookmark.

== Set a Default Bookmark
The _default bookmark_ for a Dashboard specifies the settings (filter selections, menu choices, annotations) that will be in effect each time you re-open the Dashboard in the Portal. This is the “starting state” of the Dashboard.



To set an existing bookmark as the default bookmark, follow the steps below:

TIP: If you have not yet bookmarked the desired Dashboard state, see xref:#SaveNewBookmark[] above.

. Open the Dashboard for viewing. (See xref:UseDashboard.adoc[].)

. Press the {buttonBookmarks} on the right side of the toolbar. This opens the ‘Bookmark’ menu.
+
image:viewsheet:AddBookmark.png[]



. Press the {buttonSetAsDefault} next to the bookmark that you want to set as the Dashboard’s starting state.
+
image:viewsheet:Bookmark Default.png[]
+
NOTE: The default bookmark is subsequently shown in _italics_.

The Dashboard will now open with the settings defined by this default bookmark.

If you do not specify a default bookmark for a Dashboard, the Dashboard will open with the settings defined by the ‘Home’ bookmark. To remove the _default_ designation from a bookmark, simply designate a different user-created bookmark or the ‘Home’ bookmark as the default.
