[CAUTION]
====
An entity name can contain any characters. However, the following characters and character combinations have been observed to cause problems on certain databases in particular usages. If you use these characters in an entity name, thorough testing with your database is recommended.

 ! ? [ ] < > ^ ` \ ' = " {D {d {T {t ( : $()
====

. In the ‘Add Attributes’ dialog box, select the fields (columns) that should be used as attributes for the entity. Press btn:[OK].
