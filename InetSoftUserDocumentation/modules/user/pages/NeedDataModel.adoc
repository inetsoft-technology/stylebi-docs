= Do You Need a Data Model?

A *data model* is a simplified representation of the underlying database schema. The data model reorganizes the database tables and columns to provide a simplified entity-attribute interface for users who are designing  Dashboards. For example, the ‘Order Model’ data model below  organizes attributes into a set of five entities, ‘Customer’, ‘Order’, ‘Product’, ‘Salesperson’, and ‘Supplier’.

You should consider creating a data model if you have the following objectives:

* Reduce the number of individual queries that need to be created and maintained
* Provide self-service access to business users
* Provide a simplified view of data that reduces data misrepresentation
* Allow data to be filtered on fields that are not included in a Dashboard
* Avoid the need for users to perform joins


== Create a Data Model


NOTE: Data models are available only for relational data sources. Data models are not available for the ‘Hadoop Hive’ data source.


A data model comprises a physical view and logical model:

* *Physical View:* A physical view specifies a subset of database tables and the join relationships between them, covering all or part of the database schema. The physical view transforms the original database schema into a business intelligence-friendly schema, which can then be exposed to designers and end users through one or more logical models. See xref:PhysicalView.adoc[] for information on constructing a physical view.
* *Logical Model:* A logical model is based on a single physical view, and presents a business-oriented, easy-to-understand representation of the physical view by mapping database tables into [.Emphasis]#entities# and columns into [.Emphasis]#attributes#. The logical model denormalizes the data (adds additional redundancy) in order to maximize simplicity for data analysts and end users. See xref:LogicalModel.adoc[] for information on constructing a logical model.
