IMPORTANT: Physical views can only be created for relational databases. (See xref:JDBC.adoc[]  or  xref:ConnectToDataSource.adoc[] for information on how to configure a relational database data source.)

To create a physical view, follow the steps below:

. Press the top {buttonData}.

. Add tables to the physical view. Follow the steps below:

.. *_Optional:_*  To filter the list of available tables, use the ‘Search’ box to enter the name (or partial name) of the tables to which you want to restrict the listing.

.. Click to select the tables to add to the physical view. (Add all the tables from which you want the data model to be able to retrieve data.)

.. *_Optional:_*  To add a custom table based on a SQL query, see xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc#AddInlineSQL[Add Inline SQL] in xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc[].

.. *_Optional:_*  To hide the tables you have not selected, press the  {buttonOnlyShowDelectedTable} at the top of the ‘Tables’ panel.

.. To display the columns within a table, press the {buttonShowColumns}.

. Add joins to create relations between the tables. To add an individual join between tables, follow the steps below. To automatically add joins between many tables, see xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc#AutomaticallyCreateJoins[Automatically Create Joins] in xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc[].
+
CAUTION: Physical views are susceptible to *query traps* that can cause unexpected results.  See xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc#IdentifyQueryTraps[Identify Query Traps] for more information.


.. Click the first table in the left panel that you want to join. Drag the {buttonJoinHandle}  from the first table onto the  of the second table. This opens the Join Editor.
+

+
If a join between the tables already exists, click on the join link to open the ‘Edit Join’ dialog box.
+

+
The ‘Edit Join’ dialog box allows you to modify the join operator (inner/equal, outer, or inequality), and set the cardinality, merging rule, and weak join. See xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc#ModifyJoinProperties[Modify Join Properties] for more information about these join settings.

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Edit Join’ dialog box.

.. To remove an existing join, right-click on the join link, and select ‘Remove Join Condition’.
+

.. To create a new join, simply drag the desired join field from one table into the other table. Repeat to create any additional joins.

.. Press btn:[Done] to exit the Join Editor.

You can also add a join by selecting a table, and pressing the {buttonAddJoin}.

This opens the ‘Add Join’ dialog box. Choose the join column within the selected table (‘Column’) and the ‘Foreign column’ within a desired ‘Foreign table’, and press btn:[OK].

. To delete a join, select the table from which the join is an outgoing join, and press the {buttonRemoveSelectedJoins}.

. Repeat the above steps to join all tables in the physical view. (To automatically add joins between many tables, see xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc#AutomaticallyCreateJoins[Automatically Create Joins] in xref:EditPhysicalView.adoc[].)

. Press the {buttonSave} to save the physical view.
