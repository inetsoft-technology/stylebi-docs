+
.Attribute Properties
****

Attribute Name:: Change the attribute name by entering a name in the ‘Attribute Name’ field.
+
[CAUTION]
====
An attribute name can contain any characters except a *period* (“.”). However, the following characters and character combinations have been observed to cause problems on certain databases in particular usages. If you use these characters in an attribute name, thorough testing with your database is recommended.

 ! [ ] ? { & } : ^ ` \ ' " = / < > $()
====

Data Type:: Assign a data type (‘Integer’, String’, etc.) from the ‘Data Type’ menu.

Physical Column:: To change the physical model field that is represented by the logical model attribute, select the desired field from the ‘Physical Column’ menu.

Format:: To add formatting to the data returned in an attribute,  click the ‘Format’ menu and choose the desired format from the ‘Format Type’ menu.

[square]
* For ‘Date’ format, you can select one of the automatic formats (‘Full’, ‘Long’, ‘Medium’, or ‘Short’), or select ‘Custom’ to specify an optional format pattern string.
+
.See a list  of available date format symbols...
[%collapsible]
====
For examples of how  to construct dates using these symbols, see xref:viewsheet:DataFormat.adoc#DateFormat[Date Format] in xref:viewsheet:VisualizeYourData.adoc[].


include::commonscript:partial$dateFormatTable.adoc[]
====
+
For example, to format a date as ‘Jan 01, 2000’, use `MMM dd, yyyy`. You can select a format from the menu, or type your own into the text field.

* For ‘Number’ format, the number format pattern must be constructed using the following symbols.
+
include::commonscript:partial$numberFormatTable.adoc[]
+
For example, to add commas to a number, use `pass:[#, ###, ###. ##]`. Adding a `%` at the end of the format will multiply the value by 100 and display as a percentage. You can select a format from the menu, or type your own into the text field.
+
NOTE: Decimal formatting only applies if the value is a numeric type.

Auto Drill:: To add automatic hyperlinks to an attribute,  press the ‘Edit Auto Drill’ button next to the ‘Auto Drill’ field. See xref:#AddAutoDrill[] below for more information.

Reference Type:: To specify that a field should be treated by default as a *dimension*, select ‘Dimension’ from the ‘Reference Type’ menu. To specify that a field should be treated by default as a *measure*, select the desired aggregation method from the ‘Measure’ list in the ‘Reference Type’ menu. The ‘Reference Type’ setting determines the attribute’s default behavior (as dimension or measure) in aggregation contexts such as dashboard charts and crosstabs, etc. (This behavior can be changed by the dashboard designer.)
+
include::ROOT:partial$measureAndDimensionTip.adoc[]

Browse Data:: To allow designers and users to browse the attribute values using the {buttonBrowseData} when they set a filtering condition on the attribute, enable the ‘Browse Data’ option for the attribute. By default, ‘Browse Data’ allows designers and users to select from a list of the distinct values contained in the first 1000 rows.
****

. Press the {buttonSave} to save the logical model.

[#AddAutoDrill]
== Add Auto Drill

The *auto-drill* feature allows you to add hyperlinks to  an attribute in a logical model. The hyperlinks will then be present in any Dashboard that uses the attribute. For example, if you place an auto-drill on the ‘State’ attribute of a data model, then all tables and charts that display the ‘State’ attribute will have hyperlinks on the states. These hyperlinks can link to a web page or to another Dashboard.

=== Auto Drill Walkthrough

To add auto-drills to a data model, follow the steps below:

. Open the logical model for editing. (See above.)

. Expand an entity in the model, and click to select the attribute that you want to modify.
+
image:dataModel47.png[]

. Press the ‘Edit Auto Drill’ btn:[...] button next to the ‘Auto Drill’ field. This opens the ‘Edit Auto Drill‘ dialog box.
+
image:dataModel48.png[]

. In the ‘Edit Auto Drill’ dialog box, press the {buttonAddDrill} to create a new auto-drill. The new drill is assigned a default name such as ‘drill0’, ‘drill1’, etc.
+
image:dataModel49.png[]


. Rename the new drill by entering a name in the ‘Name’ field.

. Enter a tooltip in the ‘Tooltip’ field.  The tooltip is displayed when the user hovers the mouse over a hyperlink. If there are multiple hyperlinks for a given attribute, the tooltip of each hyperlink is displayed when the user hovers the mouse over the name of the drill in the menu of hyperlink options.

. To add a hyperlink that targets a *dashboard*, select the ‘Asset Link’ option, and select the desired dashboard from the ‘Link’ menu.
+
image:dataModel50.png[]
+
NOTE: Typically, the dashboard that the drill targets will contain a condition that filters the data based on the value passed in the drill hyperlink. For example, in this case the dashboard might contain a parameterized condition such as  `Company is equal to $(customer)`, where the value of variable `customer` will be supplied by the auto-drill hyperlink. (See how to add a parameter below.)

. To add a hyperlink to a *web page* , select the ‘Web Link’ option, and enter the desired URL. See below for information about embedding parameters in the URL.
+
image:dataModel51.png[]


. *_Optional:_*  If you want the target dashboard or web page to be displayed in a particular browser window, deselect the ‘Self’ option, and enter the name of the desired window in the ‘Target Frame’ field.  (The specified name becomes the DOM ‘name’ attribute.) Enter `_blank` to open the dashboard or web page in a new browser window or tab. To specify that the target dashboard or web page should open in the User Portal frame, replacing the previous dashboard, select the ‘Self’ checkbox.

. *_Optional:_*  If you have selected ‘Asset Link’, and the target dashboard is configured to display a parameter prompt when opened, you can bypass the prompt by selecting ‘Disable Parameter Prompt’.

. *_Optional:_* If you want to use the hyperlinked text or value to retrieve a *related value* from a Data Worksheet, press the ‘Query Selection’ button btn:[...] next to the ‘Data Worksheet’ field.
+
image:dataModel97.png[]

. From the ‘Query Selection’ dialog box, select the Data Worksheet whose primary data block contains the values to retrieve. The primary data block should generally have a condition on it that filters the query to return a single value based on the link the user clicks. (See  xref:dataworksheet:QueryData.adoc[] for information on how to create an independent query with a condition.)
+
.Query Selection
[example]
====
For example, a Data Worksheet named ‘getProdID’ might return product IDs with the following condition,

[source]
SA.PRODUCTS.PRODUCT_NAME is equal to $(userProductChoice)

where `userProductChoice` is the name of a variable. If you select this Data Worksheet in the ‘Query Selection’ dialog box, you can also select the field of the data model that should be passed into the `userProductChoice` variable when the user clicks the hyperlink.

image:dataModel95.png[]

The Data Worksheet will apply the condition based on this value and return the related value (in this example, the corresponding product ID), which you can then pass as a parameter in the hyperlink. (See below.)
====

. *_Parameters:_* If you intend to pass  the hyperlinked text or value to the drill-down dashboard or web page when the user clicks the link, follow the steps below:

.. Press the {buttonAddParameter} next to the ‘Parameters’ field. This opens the ‘Parameter’ dialog box.

.. In the ‘Parameter Name’ field, enter the name of a dashboard or web page parameter   that you want to receive the value passed in the hyperlink.

.. If you want the auto-drill hyperlink to pass the *hyperlinked value* to the drill-down dashboard or web page, select ‘Field’ under ‘Parameter Source’. In the ‘Parameter Value’ field, select `this.column` to indicate that the value passed in the hyperlink will be the hyperlinked text itself. For example, if the hyperlinked text is ‘Interstate Reseller’, the parameter value passed in the hyperlink when the user clicks will be ‘Interstate Reseller’.
+
image:dataModel53.png[]
+
If you are using  ‘Query’ look-up (see above), you can choose the *value returned by the  query* to pass in the hyperlink.
+
image:dataModel96.png[]
+
By default, parameters are passed in the hyperlink URL as *key-value* pairs, e.g., `?key=value`.
+
.Key-Value Pair Parameter
[example]
If the ‘Web Link’ URL for the auto-drill is https://www.google.com/search, and you specify a parameter named `q` for the ‘customer’ field, when the user clicks the hyperlinked customer value ‘Direct Sales’ (for example), the resulting hyperlink URL will be https://www.google.com/search?q=Direct%20Sales, incorporating the specified hyperlink parameter and value (or the value returned by query lookup) as a key-value pair.
+
You can also *embed* parameters within the URL itself. To do this, use the `$(parameter)` syntax.
+
.Embedded Parameter
[example]
If the URL for ‘Web Link’ is https://www.inetsoft.com/$(param1), the value of `param1` will be substituted into the URL, yielding, for example,  https://www.inetsoft.com/services if the value of `param1` is “services”. Parameters that are *not referenced* with the `$(parameter)` syntax in the URL are added as a key-value pairs instead, as described above.

.. If you want the auto-drill hyperlink to pass a fixed value to the drill-down dashboard or web page, select ‘Constant’ under ‘Parameter Source’. In the ‘Type’ field, select the data type of the constant that the hyperlink will pass.  In the ‘Parameter Value’ field, enter the fixed value that the hyperlink should pass.

.. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Parameter’ dialog box.

. To add additional parameters, repeat the above steps.

. To delete a parameter from the hyperlink, press the {buttonDeleteParameter} next to the parameter name. To delete all parameters, press the {buttonCleanParameters} button above the parameter list.

. Enable the ‘Send Dashboard Parameters’ option to pass dashboard-level parameters in the hyperlink (in addition to the auto-drill parameter specified above).
+
TIP: Dashboard parameters are parameters defined within the dashboard containing the hyperlinks.  See xref:viewsheet:DynamicallySetProperties.adoc[] in xref:viewsheet:VisualizeYourData.adoc[] and xref:viewsheetscript:parameter.adoc[] in xref:viewsheetscript:AdvancedDashboardScripting.adoc[] for more information about parameters.
+
The drill-down dashboard or web-page should be designed to accept these parameter values, or they will be ignored. In the case of a drill-down dashboard (‘Asset Link’ option), the parameters are passed into *parameters of the same name*, if they exist, in the drill-down dashboard. In the case of a drill-down web page (‘Web Link’ option), the parameters are passed in the URL as key-value pairs.
+
.Send Dashboard Parameters
[example]
====
Consider a dashboard that has the following dashboard parameters defined in the *onInit* script. (See xref:viewsheetscript:AddScriptToDashboard.adoc[] for  information about how to add script.)

[source,javascript]
parameter.param1 = hello
parameter.param2 = goodbye

If ‘Send Dashboard Parameters’ is enabled, and the web link for the auto-drill is https://www.google.com/search, when the user clicks the hyperlinked value ‘Direct Sales’ (for example), the resulting hyperlink URL will be https://www.google.com/search?param1=hello&param2=goodbye&q=Direct%20Sales, incorporating the dashboard parameters and the specified hyperlink parameter as key-value pairs.
====

. *_Optional:_*  Press the {buttonAddDrill} again and repeat the steps above to add additional hyperlinks to the attribute. If you add more than one drill to a given attribute, the end-user will be presented with a menu of hyperlink choices corresponding to the different drills you have assigned.

. Press btn:[OK] to close the ‘Edit Auto Drill’ dialog box.

. Press the {buttonSave} to save the logical model.
