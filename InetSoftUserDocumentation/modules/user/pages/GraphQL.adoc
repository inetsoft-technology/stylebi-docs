. In the ‘Name’ field, enter a label for this data source connection.

. Enter the ‘URL’ for the web service.

. Select an '`Authentication`' method (if desired). The options are ‘Basic’, ‘Two-step Token’, and ‘Oauth 2.0’.
+
****
Basic:: If you select ‘Basic’, simply enter a username and password.

Two-step Token:: If you select ‘Two-step Token’, specify the required information for obtaining a token (step one) and requesting data using the token (step two). Follow the steps below:

.. Enter a username and password.

.. Enter the ‘Authentication URI’.

.. Press the btn:[Add] button below the ‘Authentication HTTP Parameters’ label to add parameter names and values. From the menu on the right side specify ‘Header’ or ‘Query’ to indicate where the parameters should be attached.

.. In the ‘Auth HTTP Method’, select either ‘GET’ or ‘POST’ for the first-step query. If you select ‘POST’, select a value from the ‘Content Type’ menu {contentType}, and enter the ‘Request Body’. For example:
+
[source,json]
{
"username": "admin",
"password": "admin"
}

.. Enter the ‘Token Regex Pattern’. The regex you enter should extract the token from the response of this query. For example: `"token":"(.*?)"`.

Oauth 2.0:: If you select ‘Oauth 2.0’, follow the steps below:

.. Enter the ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client Secret’, ‘Authorization URI’, ‘Token URI’, and ‘Scope’. For more details about these settings, see the https://oauth.net/2/[Oauth 2.0 Framework Documentation].

.. *_Optional:_* Enter one or both of the following values (space separated) in the ‘Oauth Flags’ field. Use flag `credentialsInTokenRequestBody` to put the ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client Secret’ credentials  in the body of the request to the ‘Token URI’ when the authorization code is swapped for the access token value. Use flag `useAuthorizationCodeForRefresh` to indicate that the data source doesn’t provide the typical refresh token when swapping the authorization code for the access token or refresh token, and to use the authorization code again in place of a refresh token after the token expires.

.. Press btn:[Authorize] to populate the ‘Access Token’ and ‘Refresh Token’ fields.
****

. *_Optional:_* Under the ‘Query HTTP Parameters’ field, press the btn:[Add] button to add the retrieved token into a parameter for the second-step query, as illustrated below (for generic REST data source). You can use the predefined `pass:[{{token}}]` variable to represent the retrieved token value in the query.

+
. *_Optional:_* {multiTenantUser}

. Press btn:[OK].

. Verify that the data source you added is shown with a {buttonCheckIcon}, indicating that the connection was successful.

+
If the database is shown with an {buttonError}, this means that the connection was not successful.

In this case, check the settings to make sure they are correct for your database. See xref:EditConnection.adoc[] for information on how to change connection settings.

After you have created a connection to the database, you can proceed to define a data set. See xref:dataworksheet:QueryGraphQL.adoc[].
