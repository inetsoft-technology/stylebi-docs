You can specify that certain columns in database tables should be restricted by the VPM. These are called *hidden columns*. To hide columns, follow the steps below:

. If necessary, create a VPM as explained in xref:CreateNewVPM.adoc[].

. Select the *Hidden Columns* tab at the bottom.

The columns listed in the ‘Hidden Columns’ pane are automatically hidden from all users, except for those who are associated with at least one of the roles listed in the ‘Grant to’ pane.

. Add the desired roles to the ‘Grant to’ pane by select the roles in the ‘Available Roles’ panel and pressing the {buttonAddArrow}.

. To add scripted logic that triggers the column hiding, see xref:AddVPMHiddenColumnTrigger.adoc[].

. Press the {buttonSave} to save the VPM.

Once the hidden columns are specified, the tables containing those columns are automatically listed in the *Lookup* tab. This indicates that the VPM security will be applied to any query that contains those tables.

NOTE: A column that is derived from one or more hidden columns by an expression will be accessible only to users who have permissions for *all*  the columns used in the expression.
