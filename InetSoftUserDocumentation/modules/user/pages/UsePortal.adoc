The User Portal provides features for accessing and managing existing assets, such as Data Worksheets and Dashboards, and allows you to create new assets as well. The User Portal is a web-based interface, so you do not need to install any special software on your computer. Your system administrator will tell you the correct address to use in your web browser.

Follow the steps below:


. On the main landing page, press the  '`Dashboard Portal`' link.

. Login to the server.  If security is enabled on the server, you must log in before you can use the Portal. Enter your username and password in the provided ‘User’ and ‘Password’ fields. (Ask your system administrator if you don’t know your username and password.) If you are prompted to enter a ‘Locale’, select the correct option for your location.
