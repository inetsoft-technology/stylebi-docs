. Enter the desired GraphQL query in the ‘Query’ field. See the https://graphql.org/[GraphQL site] for more information about syntax and usage. An example of a simple query (without variables or pagination) is shown below:
+
[source]
{
    shop {
        name
    }
}



. Enter the  desired ‘JSON Path’.  See https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/[JSONPath - XPath for JSON] for information about the JSON Path syntax.

Example: JSON Path:: Consider the data at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.  The JSONPath string

+
 $.[*][?(@.id < 4)].email
+
retrieves just the `email` field from all objects where the `id` field value is less than 4.
