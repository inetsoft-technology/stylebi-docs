To sort data in a Data Worksheet, see the sections below. You can sort data on a single column or multiple columns. Sorting in a Data Worksheet may be most efficient when you want to use the sorted data across many Dashboards. Otherwise, you can simply allow the user to  sort at the presentation level (Dashboard).

[NOTE]
====
* To sort data at the query level, see xref:QueryData.adoc[].
* To sort data in a Dashboard, see xref:viewsheet:SortData.adoc[].
