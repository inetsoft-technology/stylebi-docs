The following sections explain how to define  a Variable and use it within a Condition.  See xref:FilterData.adoc[] for information on how to specify a filter condition.

== Define a Variable
To create a new Variable, follow these steps:

. Press the {buttonCreateObject} in the toolbar and select {buttonVariable}.
+
image:variableButtonToolbar.png[]
+
This opens the ‘Variable Properties’ dialog box.
+
image:parameterDialog.png[]

. Enter a ‘Name’ for the new Variable asset. This is the name that appears in the title bar of the Variable asset.
+
include::ROOT:partial$duplicateNames.adoc[]
. Enter a ‘Label’ for the Variable. This is the label that appears in the parameter dialog box that prompts the user.
. Select the data type of the Variable from the ‘Type’ menu. This is the data type of the values that the Variable will provide to the filtering condition.
. In the ‘Selection List’ panel, specify the source of the Variable data:
** Select ‘*None*’ to prompt the user with an empty text field (no choices).
** Select ‘*Embedded*’ to enter a fixed list of choices. Press the btn:[Edit] button to open the ‘Embedded List Values’ dialog box.
+
image:SelectionList_2.png[]
+
.. Press btn:[Add] to create a new label/value pair. A label/value pair defines a particular choice that will be shown to the user in the input dialog box.
.. In the ‘Label’ field, enter the text that should be displayed to the user for this particular choice.
.. In the corresponding ‘Value’ field, enter the text that should be used in the filtering condition for this particular choice. (If the ‘Type’ option in the ‘Variable Properties’ dialog box specifies a numeric type, you can only enter numerical values.)
.. Repeat to add all the choices that should be presented to the user.
.. To change the position of a item in the list, select the item, and press the btn:[Move Up] or btn:[Move Down].
.. Press btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Embedded List Values’ dialog box.
** Select ‘*Query*’ to populate the list of choices with the data in an existing table column. Press the btn:[Select] button to open the ‘Table’ dialog box.
+

+
.. From the list box on the left side, select the table that contains the data you want to use.
.. From the ‘Value Column’ menu, select the column that contains the data to be used in the filtering condition. Each row of the ‘Value Column’ represents a possible value of the Variable.
.. In the ‘Label Column’ menu, select the column that contains the labels to be displayed to the user. Each row of the ‘Label Column’ should contain the label for the corresponding row of the ‘Value Column’.
.. Press btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Table’ dialog box.
. In the ‘Display Style’ panel, select the type of list to display to the user.
+
The ‘Combo Box’ and ‘Radio Buttons’ options allow the user to make a single selection. The ‘List’ and ‘Checkboxes’ options allow the user to make multiple selections. (Multiple selections can be used in conjunction with the ‘one of’ condition operator.)
. Press  btn:[OK] to exit the ‘Variable Properties’ panel.

Note that the Variable is a reusable asset. If you want to use it within another Data Worksheet, right-click on the Variable and select ‘Set as Primary’. {rightClickOptions} See the example below.

.Example: Define a Variable
****
Assume that you have several Data Worksheets that return customer order and contact information. You would like to filter the data in these Data Worksheets so that only customers for a particular *state* are returned. You can do this by creating a Variable that prompts the user to specify a state, and you can reuse this Variable in any Data Worksheet that requires such input.

Follow these steps to create a Variable:

. Create a new Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]

. Press the {buttonCreateObject} in the toolbar and select {buttonVariable}.
+
image:variableButtonToolbar.png[]
+
This opens the ‘Variable Properties’ dialog box.
+
image:parameterDialog.png[]
. Specify “state” as the name of the Variable.
. Specify “State” as the Label.
. Select ‘String’ from the drop-down list for Type.
. Uncheck the ‘None’ check box next to ‘Default Value’, and enter “CA” as the default value.
. Ensure that ‘None’ is selected for the Selection List.
+
image:parameterCA.png[]
. Press btn:[OK].
. Right-click on the new Variable in the Data Worksheet and select ‘Set as Primary’. {rightClickOptions}
+
image:statePrimary.png[]
. Press the {buttonSave} in the top toolbar. This opens the ‘Save as Data Worksheet’ dialog.
. Specify “State” as the asset name.
+
image:saveStateWorksheet.png[]
. Press btn:[OK] to add the ‘State’ Variable to the left panel. Notice that the name of the asset in the left panel is shown with a {buttonVariableIcon} indicating that the asset is a Variable.

This example is continued in xref:UseVariable[] below, where the ‘state’ Variable is used in another Data Worksheet.

== Use a Variable
The example below illustrates how to use a Variable within a Condition.  It continues the example in xref:DefineVariable[] above.

.Example: Use a Variable
****
Assume you have a table listing order data for all states, but you are interested in working with the data for only one particular state at a time. To do this, you will add a filtering condition on the ‘State’ field of the table based on the ‘State’ Variable. You will use the existing ‘State’ Variable from the asset repository. (See the above example for instructions on how to create this Variable).

. Create a new Data Worksheet.
include::ROOT:partial$CreateNewWorksheetNote.adoc[]

. From the left panel, drag the ‘Sales Explore’ Data Worksheet into the new Data Worksheet. This creates the data block ‘Sales1’.
+
image:importWorksheet_2.png[]
+
include::ROOT:partial$SalesExploreWorksheet.adoc[]

. From the left panel, drag the ‘State’ Variable into the right panel. This imports the variable into the Data Worksheet as ‘state.`'
+
image:DragStateWorksheet.png[]
+
. Select the ‘Sales1’ data block, and press the {buttonDefineCondition} in the bottom panel to open the ‘Condition’ dialog box.
. Press the btn:[More] button to add a new condition.
. Create the condition `[State] [is] [equal to]`.
. Press the {buttonChangeValueType} and select ‘Variable`'.
+
image:SwitchtoVariableCondition.png[]
. From the ‘Variable Name’ menu, select ‘state’.
+
image:Stateequaltostate.png[]
. Press btn:[OK]. You will be prompted for the value of the ‘state’ Variable.
. Enter “FL” and press btn:[OK].
+

. Preview the data block (see xref:PreviewData.adoc[]), and note that only the sales for the state of Florida are now shown.
