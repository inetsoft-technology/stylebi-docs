. Enter the ‘URL Suffix’ and a desired ‘JSON Path’.  See https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/[JSONPath - XPath for JSON] for information about the JSON Path syntax.

****
Example: JSON Path:: Consider the data at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.  The JSONPath string
+
 $.[*][?(@.id < 4)]
+
retrieves all fields (because none are specified) from all objects where the `id` field value is less than 4. The JSONPath string
+
 $.[*][?(@.id < 4)].email
+
retrieves just the `email` field from all objects where the `id` field value is less than 4.

. *_Optional:_*  Select ‘Expand Arrays’ to expand a record that contains an array into multiple records.
