To create a new data set from an existing R  connection, follow the steps below:

. If you have not yet configured the database connection, see xref:user:R.adoc[]. Then proceed with the steps below.

. Open the Data Worksheet that will contain the data. (See xref:dataworksheet:CreateNewWorksheet.adoc[] or xref:dataworksheet:EditDataWorksheet.adoc[].)

. Press the {buttonObject}, and select {buttonRQuery}.

This opens the ‘R  Query’ dialog box.

. Enter the desired R script. This can be simply the name of the data set (e.g., “iris”) or a more elaborate analysis script.
+
NOTE: If the last statement in the script is a data frame, this data is returned in full by the script. For large data sets, this may result in high memory consumption. To avoid this, the script can also return a string containing the name of a variable that points to a data frame. The data will then be streamed from a temporary CVS file to the Data Worksheet, with reduced memory consumption.

. *_Optional:_* In the ‘Pre-execution JavaScript’ field, enter a script to write data from data blocks and variables in the Data Worksheet into the R session. Use variable `r` to do this. For example, to create  data frame `in_data` in the R session containing the data from Worksheet data block ‘Query1’, use the following pre-execution script:
+
 r.in_data = Query1;
+
To create a variable `my_param` in the R session containing the value from Worksheet variable ‘InputVar’, use the following pre-execution script:
+
 r.my_param = parameter.InputVar;

. *_Optional:_* In the ‘Post-execution JavaScript’ field, enter a script to write data from the R session into a Worksheet Embedded Table. Use variable `r` to do this. For example, to write a data frame `residuals` from the R session into Worksheet Embedded Table ‘Residuals’, use the following post-execution script:
+
 Residuals.table = r.residuals;
+
To write the value of  variables `rmse` and `mape` from the R session into Worksheet Embedded Table ‘Accuracy’, use the following post-execution script:
+
[source]
Accuracy.table = [
    [ "RMSE", "MAPE" ],
    [ r.rmse, r.mape ]
];
