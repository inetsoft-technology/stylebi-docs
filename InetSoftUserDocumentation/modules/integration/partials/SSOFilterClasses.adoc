The filter classes perform the following operations:

SecurityHeaderFilter:: Adds security-related headers into the HTTP response.  By default, the `X-Frame-Options` header is set to `SAMEORIGIN`. Set the `security.allow.iframe=true` to prevent the header from being added. By default, the `X-XSS-Protection` header is not added. Set  `security.enableXSSProtection=true` to set the `X-XSS-Protection` header to “1”. By default, the `X-Content-Type-Options` header is not added. Set  `security.enableContentTypeOptions=true` to set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff`. {EMPropertyConfig}

InvalidateSessionFilter:: Ensures that sessions with an invalid principal (i.e., sessions where the principal in the `RepletRepository.PRINCIPAL_COOKIE` attribute is not active) are invalidated and logged-out.

LogoutFilter:: Handles requests from the client to log out of the application, intercepting requests to `/logout`. This class redirects to the URL specified by property `portal.logout.url`, or to `/app/portal` if the property is not set. {EMPropertyConfig}
BasicAuthenticationFilter:: Handles authentication of the client with the basic authentication HTTP headers in the request. (The default login page uses HTTP basic authentication.) If authentication is successful, the class sets an SRPrincipal object in the session's `RepletRepository.PRINCIPAL_COOKIE` attribute.

DefaultAuthorizationFilter:: Redirects the client to the login page if the associated principal is not authorized to access the requested resource. For XHR (AJAX/REST/JavaScript) requests, this filter just returns a “401 Unauthorized” response.
AnonymousUserFilter:: This associates an anonymous user principal with the request if none has already been associated by a preceding filter.
RequestPrincipalFilter:: Injects the principal from the `RepletRepository.PRINCIPAL_COOKIE` session attribute (obtained with the `getUserPrincipal` and `getRemoteUser` methods)  into the HTTP request object. In most cases, this filter should not be removed and should always be applied last.
SSOLogoutFilter:: A helper filter that handles logging the user out of the application and invalidating the HTTP session after the SSO implementation-specific logout has been performed. This filter detects logout requests using one of two properties: `sso.logout.parameter`, corresponding to a query parameter, or `sso.logout.path`, corresponding to a URL path.


SSOPrincipalFilter:: A helper filter takes the principal returned from the request object and creates a session in the application for the authenticated user. It is fairly standard for security filters to put their principal into the request for subsequent processing. If your filters do not do this, you will need to provide this in a custom filter. (See xref:integration:ConfigureSingleSignOn.adoc#SSOUsingCustomFilter[SSO Using Custom Filter].) However, in this configuration, you do not need to create an instance of SRPrincipal; you can delegate that to the `SSOPrincipalFilter`.
