* Automated (consistent, and repeatable) deployment of containers
* Automatic scaling of containers
* Automatic system and resource management, including storage, networking, and security
* Support for DevOps for easy integration into CI/CD pipelines
* Support by many cloud infrastructures, including Amazon (EKS), Azure (AKS), and Google Cloud (GKE)

InetSoft provides a set of images designed for use in Docker or deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.
