= Configure Single Sign-On

Single Sign-On (SSO) is the process of transparently passing user credentials from one application to another so that the user is only required to present login credentials a single time. This helps to create a seamless user experience.

You can implement single sign-on (SSO) by injecting a principal object into the HTTP request object as part of the security filter chain. This allows StyleBI to automatically sign in the user without attempting to authenticate credentials. The StyleBI *SRPrincipal* object is used to hold the security information. You can create the SRPrincipal object yourself or let StyleBI create it for you. (See xref:AccessUserSession.adoc[] for additional information.)

The following sections explain the security filter chain and methods of implementing SSO.

== SSO Using OpenID
To implement SSO using OpenID Connect, follow the steps below:

. Open the *Security* page in Enterprise Manager, and select the SSO tab. From ‘Pick an SSO Provider’, select ‘OpenID Connect’.
+
image:administration:SSO2.png[]

. Use the ‘Default Role(s)’ menu to select default role or roles for new users signing in.

. Set the ‘Single Sign-Out URL’ as desired. For Auth0, this may include a `returnTo` query parameter that redirects the user after logout. If this parameter is included then you must list that URL in the Auth0 application's *Allowed Logout URLs*.

. Set the ‘Single Sign-Out Callback Path’ to `https://yourserver:port/context/sso/login`.

. *_Optional:_* Enable ‘Allow Default Form Login’ to use the default login page when navigating directly to _/login.html_.

. Enter the following properties:
+
****
OIDC Discovery URL (Optional)::  URL for the Open ID Connect discovery document. Example for Auth0: `pass:[https://_domain_/.well-known/openid-configuration]`.
Client ID:: The OAuth 2.0 client ID for the authentication request.
Client Secret:: The OAuth 2.0 client secret for the authentication request.
Scopes:: The scopes to request when performing the authorization. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
Authorization Endpoint:: The endpoint that performs the authentication. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
Token Endpoint:: The endpoint that returns the token response. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
JWKS URL:: The URL of the key set used to verify token signatures. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
JWK Certificate:: The PEM-encoded certificate for the key used to verify token signatures. This will  be ignored if the ‘JWKS URL’ is specified.
Name Claim:: The name of the claim to be used for the username. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
Role Claim:: The name of the claim to be used for the assigned role. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
Group Claim:: The name of the claim to be used for the assigned group. If the ‘OIDC Discovery URL’ is specified, this will auto-complete with the scopes defined in the discovery document.
Organization Id Claim:: The name of the claim to be used for the assigned organization.
****

. Restart the InetSoft server.

== SSO Using SAML
To implement SSO using SAML, follow the steps below:

. Open the *Security* page in Enterprise Manager, and select the *SSO* tab. From ‘Pick an SSO Provider’, select ‘SAML’.
+
image:administration:SSO1.png[]

. Use the ‘Default Role(s)’ menu to select default role or roles for new users signing in.

. *_Optional:_* Enable ‘Allow Default Form Login’ to use the default login page when navigating directly to _/login.html_.

. Enter the following properties:
+
****
spEntityId:: The entity ID of the SP (the InetSoft application). Entity IDs are URIs that identify SAML-based services.
assertionUrl:: The Assertion Consumer Service URL (Application Callback URL in Auth0)  where the SAML token is returned, for example, `http://app_host:8080/saml/login`.
idpEntityId:: The entity ID of the identity provider.
idpSignOnUrl:: The login URL of the identity provider.
idpPublicKey:: The public key of the identity provider.
idpLogoutUrl:: The single-sign-out URL for the identity provider.
****



. Restart the InetSoft server.


[#SSOUsingCustomFilter]
== SSO Using Custom Filter

If you are not using  SAML, OpenID, or Auth0, you can provide a custom filter that creates an SRPrincipal object with the information provided by the SSO mechanism. To implement a basic SSO filter, follow the steps below:

. Decide whether you will compile a Java filter class or use an inline Groovy class. To compile a Java class follow the steps below:

.. Create an SSO filter class based on this xref:ROOT:attachment$SampleFilter.java[SampleFilter] skeleton code. Add your own business logic in the `doFilter()` method where indicated.
+
.See SampleFilter code...
